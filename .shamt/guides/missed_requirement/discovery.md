# PHASE 1: Discovery & User Decision

**Purpose:** Identify missing requirement and get user decision on approach

**When to Use:** Missing requirement discovered at any point after first S5 starts

**Previous Phase:** None (entry point from any workflow stage)

**Next Phase:** PHASE 2 (Planning) - See `missed_requirement/planning.md`

---

## Triggered When

**Missing requirement can be discovered during ANY stage after first S5 starts:**

**During Feature Implementation (S5):**
- S5 (TODO creation): Realize missing scope while planning implementation
- S6 (Implementation): Discover forgotten functionality while coding
- S7 (Smoke Testing): Find missing requirement during Part 1/2/3 tests
- S7 (Validation Loop): Discover missing scope during validation rounds

**During Debugging:**
- While investigating issues: Realize root cause is missing functionality
- After fixing bugs: Discover the fix revealed missing scope

**During Epic-Level Work (S9/7):**
- S9.P1 (Epic Smoke Testing): Find missing integration between features
- S9.P2 (Epic Validation Loop): Discover missing epic-level functionality
- S10 (User Testing): User reports missing functionality that was in original intent

**User Reports:**
- User explicitly requests missing functionality
- User identifies gap in original epic scope

---

## Step 1: Discover Missing Requirement

**Example scenarios:**

### Example 1: Discovered during implementation
```text
Currently: feature_02_projection_system (S6 - Implementation)

Discovery: We forgot to include player injury status tracking
- Projections should account for injury status
- This was in original epic intent but not in any feature spec
- Solution is clear: Need injury status field + API integration
```

### Example 2: Discovered during QA
```text
Currently: feature_03_performance_tracker (S7 - Validation Round 2)

Discovery: We forgot to add export functionality
- Users need to export performance reports to CSV
- This was in original epic but not in any feature
- Solution is clear: Add CSV export utility
```

### Example 3: Discovered during debugging
```text
Currently: Debugging issue_01_null_scoring (feature_01/debugging/)

Discovery: Root cause is missing validation layer
- Players without position data should be validated earlier
- This functionality was assumed to exist but doesn't
- Solution is clear: Need input validation feature
```

### Example 4: Discovered during epic testing
```text
Currently: Epic Validation Round 1 (S9.P2)

Discovery: Missing integration between features
- feature_02 and feature_04 need shared caching layer
- This integration point wasn't planned in any feature
- Solution is clear: Need caching infrastructure feature
```

---

## Step 2: Present Options to User

**Use this template to present the missed requirement:**

```markdown
I've discovered a missed requirement that needs to be addressed:

## Missed Requirement: {Brief description}

**Discovered during:** {Current stage and feature}

**What's missing:**
{Clear description of missing scope}

**Why it's needed:**
{Impact of not having this functionality}

**Estimated complexity:**
{Small / Medium / Large}

---

## Options for Handling

**OPTION 1: Create New Feature**
- Create feature_{XX}_{name}/ folder
- Full spec.md and checklist.md created
- Decide where in sequence it should be implemented
- Pros: Clean separation, clear scope
- Cons: Adds to epic feature count

**OPTION 2: Update Unstarted Feature**
Available unstarted features:
- feature_03_performance_tracker (not started yet)
- feature_04_matchup_analysis (not started yet)

Which feature should include this requirement?
- Pros: Keeps feature count stable, logical grouping
- Cons: Feature scope increases

---

## Recommended Approach

{Agent recommendation based on scope and cohesion}

**Reasoning:**
{Why this approach makes sense}

---

What would you like to do?
1. Create new feature (Option 1)
2. Update unstarted feature (Option 2) - which feature?
3. Skip for now (document and address later)
4. Other approach
```

**Wait for user response**

---

## Step 3: Determine Priority & Sequence (If Creating New Feature)

**If user chooses to create NEW feature, determine sequence position:**

### Ask user about priority

```markdown
Priority and sequence for new feature:

## Priority Level
- **High:** Blocks other features / Critical for epic
- **Medium:** Important but not blocking
- **Low:** Nice-to-have / Can be last

What priority level? {User input}

## Sequence Position
Current epic sequence:
1. feature_01_adp_integration (COMPLETE)
2. feature_02_projection_system (IN PROGRESS - S6)
3. feature_03_performance_tracker (NOT STARTED)
4. feature_04_matchup_analysis (NOT STARTED)

Where should the new feature go?
- **BEFORE feature_02** (high priority - blocks current feature)
- **AFTER feature_02** (medium priority - after current feature)
- **After feature_03** (lower priority)
- **At END** (low priority - implement last)

What sequence position? {User input}
```

### Priority & sequence decision matrix

| Priority | Sequence Position | Implementation Timing |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| **High** | BEFORE current feature | Next after current feature pauses (or immediately if blocks current) |
| **Medium** | AFTER current feature | After current feature completes |
| **Low** | At END of feature list | Last feature to implement |

**Example - High Priority:**
```text
Currently: feature_02 (S6)
New feature: feature_05_injury_tracking (high priority)

Sequence update:
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_05 ← INSERT HERE (high priority, needed by feature_02)
3. feature_02 🔄 PAUSED (resume after feature_05 completes)
4. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED

Action: After planning, implement feature_05 immediately, THEN resume feature_02
```

**Example - Medium Priority:**
```text
Currently: feature_02 (S6)
New feature: feature_05_injury_tracking (medium priority)

Sequence update:
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_02 🔄 PAUSED (resume now, complete normally)
3. feature_05 ← INSERT HERE (medium priority, after current)
4. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED

Action: Resume feature_02 now, implement feature_05 after feature_02 completes
```

**Example - Low Priority:**
```text
Currently: feature_02 (S6)
New feature: feature_05_injury_tracking (low priority)

Sequence update:
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_02 🔄 PAUSED (resume now)
3. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
4. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_05 ← INSERT AT END (low priority, implement last)

Action: Resume feature_02, implement features in order, feature_05 is last
```

---

## Step 4: Confirm with User (If Updating Unstarted Feature)

**If user chooses to update UNSTARTED feature:**

```markdown
You've chosen to update feature_{XX}_{name}

This will:
- Add new scope to feature_{XX}'s spec.md
- Update feature_{XX}'s checklist.md
- May increase implementation time
- Feature still implemented in its current sequence position

Proceed? {User confirms}
```

### Updating unstarted feature impact

| Original Feature | Updated Feature | Impact |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| feature_03_performance_tracker | feature_03_performance_tracker + injury tracking | Scope increases, stays in same sequence position |
| feature_04_matchup_analysis | feature_04_matchup_analysis + injury tracking | Scope increases, stays in same sequence position |

**Sequence position unchanged:**
- Feature keeps its original position
- Just has more scope when implemented
- May take longer to implement (document in spec)

---

## Step 5: Document Current Work State

### Update current feature's README.md (if pausing work)

**Template:**

```markdown
## Agent Status (PAUSED - Missed Requirement Handling)

**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Status:** PAUSED for missed requirement: {requirement_name}
**Paused At:** {Current stage and step}

**Missed Requirement Action:**
- {Creating new feature_05_injury_tracking} OR {Updating feature_03_performance_tracker}
- Returning to S2/3/4 for planning
- Will resume this feature after planning complete

**Resume Instructions:**
When planning complete:
1. Verify this feature's spec still valid after alignment
2. Resume at: {Exact step where paused}
3. Context: {Brief context of what was being done}

**Context at Pause:**
{Document current state, progress, any important context}
```

---

## Step 6: Update EPIC_README.md

### Add to Missed Requirement Tracking table

```markdown
## Missed Requirement Tracking

| # | Requirement | Action | Priority | Status | Created | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Player injury tracking | New feature_05 | High | S2 | 2026-01-04 | Inserting after feature_02 |
```

### Update Current Status section

```markdown
## Current Status

**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

**Missed Requirement Handling:**
- Requirement: Player injury tracking
- Action: Creating new feature_05_injury_tracking
- Priority: High
- Sequence: Insert after feature_02 (before feature_03)
- Currently: Returning to S2 for planning

**Paused Work:**
- feature_02_projection_system: Paused at S6 Phase 3
  - Resume point: After planning complete, continue Phase 3
  - Agent Status saved: README.md in feature_02/ folder
```

### Update Epic Progress Tracker (if creating new feature)

```markdown
## Epic Progress Tracker

| Feature | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | S7 | S8.P1 | S8.P2 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| feature_01_adp_integration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| feature_02_projection_system | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🔄 | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ |
| feature_03_performance_tracker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ |
| feature_04_matchup_analysis | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ |
| feature_05_injury_tracking (NEW) | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ | ◻️ |

**Implementation Sequence (Updated):**
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_02 🔄 PAUSED at S6
3. feature_05 ◻️ NOT STARTED (INSERTED - high priority)
4. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED

**Next after feature_02 resumes and completes:** feature_05 (then feature_03, then feature_04)
```
