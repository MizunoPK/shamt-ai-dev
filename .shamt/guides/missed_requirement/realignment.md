# PHASE 3 & 4: Realignment (S3 & 4) and Resume

**Purpose:** Re-align ALL features and update epic test plan, then resume paused work

**When to Use:** After PHASE 2 complete, feature spec created/updated

**Previous Phase:** PHASE 2 (Planning) - See `missed_requirement/planning.md`

**Next Phase:** Resume previous work OR proceed to new/updated feature implementation (when its turn comes)

## Overview

**PHASE 3 & 4 ensures epic coherence after adding/updating a feature:**

- **S3:** Cross-feature sanity check (ALL features)
- **S4:** Update/create feature testing strategy (test_strategy.md)
- **Resume:** Return to paused work
- **Later:** Implement new/updated feature in sequence

---

## PHASE 3: S3 - Cross-Feature Sanity Check

### Critical: Re-align ALL Features

**🚨 FIRST ACTION:** Use "Starting S3" prompt from `prompts/s3_prompts.md`

**READ:** `stages/s3/s3_epic_planning_approval.md`

**IMPORTANT:** Don't just check the new/updated feature - check ALL feature pairs

---

### Step 1: Systematic Pairwise Comparison

**Process:**

1. **New/updated feature vs ALL other features:**
   - New/updated feature vs feature_01
   - New/updated feature vs feature_02
   - New/updated feature vs feature_03
   - New/updated feature vs feature_04

2. **ALL other feature pairs** (may reveal issues):
   - feature_01 vs feature_02
   - feature_01 vs feature_03
   - feature_02 vs feature_03
   - Etc.

**For each pair, check:**
- Interface overlaps
- Data structure conflicts
- Duplicate functionality
- Integration dependencies
- Shared resources

---

### Step 2: Identify Conflicts

**Common conflict types:**

**Interface conflicts:**
```markdown
Issue: feature_02 and feature_05 both define PlayerData class
Resolution: Create shared PlayerData in utils, both features use it
```

**Data structure conflicts:**
```markdown
Issue: feature_03 expects player_id as string, feature_05 uses integer
Resolution: Standardize on integer across all features
```

**Duplicate functionality:**
```markdown
Issue: feature_04 has CSV export, now adding to feature_03
Resolution: Extract CSV export to shared utility, both features use it
```

**Integration dependencies:**
```markdown
Issue: feature_05 needs data from feature_02's projection API
Resolution: Document integration point, add to both specs
```

---

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

**For each conflict found:**

1. **Determine resolution approach:**
   - Update one feature's spec
   - Update both features' specs
   - Create shared utility
   - Refactor integration point

2. **Update affected feature specs:**
   - Document changes in spec.md
   - Update checklist.md with decision
   - Note why change was needed

3. **Get user approval for changes:**
   ```markdown
   During S3 alignment, I found a conflict:

   **Conflict:** {description}

   **Proposed Resolution:**
   {what needs to change}

   **Affected Features:**
   - feature_{XX}: {change needed}
   - feature_{YY}: {change needed}

   Approve this resolution? {User confirms}
   ```

---

### Step 4: User Sign-Off on Complete Aligned Plan

**After all conflicts resolved:**

```markdown
S3 cross-feature sanity check complete.

**Features checked:** {count} features, {count} pairwise comparisons
**Conflicts found:** {count}
**Conflicts resolved:** {count}

**Changes made:**
- feature_{XX}: {changes}
- feature_{YY}: {changes}

**All features are now aligned and ready for implementation.**

Proceed to S4 (Feature Testing Strategy update)? {User confirms}
```

---

## PHASE 4: S4 - Feature Testing Strategy Update

### Update epic_smoke_test_plan.md

**🚨 FIRST ACTION:** Use "Starting S4" prompt from `prompts/s4_prompts.md`

**READ:** `stages/s4/s4_feature_testing_strategy.md`

---

### Step 1: Add Scenarios for New/Updated Feature

**Questions to answer:**
- How does it integrate with other features?
- What epic-level workflows involve it?
- What should be tested in S9?
- What are the integration points?

**Add test scenarios:**

```markdown
## Epic Integration Test: Item Scoring with Attribute Status

**Features involved:**
- feature_02 (projection_system)
- feature_05 (injury_tracking) ← NEW

**Scenario:**
1. Load item with attribute_status = "Questionable"
2. Generate projection (should reduce projected points)
3. Verify score reflects injury adjustment

**Expected:** Projection accounts for injury status
**Success criteria:** Degraded item score < healthy item score

**Data to verify:**
- Injury status field populated
- Projection reduction applied correctly
- Score calculation uses adjusted projection
```

---

### Step 2: Update Existing Scenarios

**Review existing test scenarios:**
- Do they need updates due to new/updated feature?
- New cross-feature workflows to test?
- Data flow changes?

**Update scenarios as needed:**

```markdown
## Epic Integration Test: Draft Recommendations (UPDATED)

**Features involved:**
- feature_01 (rank_integration)
- feature_02 (projection_system)
- feature_05 (injury_tracking) ← ADDED

**Scenario:**
1. Load items with rank data
2. Load injury status for each item ← NEW STEP
3. Generate projections (accounting for injuries) ← UPDATED
4. Generate scoring recommendations

**Expected:** Recommendations account for both rank priority and injury status
**Success criteria:** Degraded high-rank priority item ranked lower than healthy equivalent
```

---

### Step 3: Identify Integration Points

**Document integration points:**

```markdown
## Integration Points

**feature_02 → feature_05:**
- feature_02 calls feature_05.get_attribute_status(player_id)
- Returns: {"status": "Healthy|Questionable|Out", "impact_factor": 0.0-1.0}

**feature_05 → feature_02:**
- None (feature_05 doesn't call feature_02)

**Shared Data:**
- player_id (integer, standardized across all features)
- PlayerData class (utils/DataRecord.py)
```

---

## PHASE 5: Resume Previous Work

### Step 1: Mark Planning Complete

**Update EPIC_README.md:**

```markdown
## Missed Requirement Tracking

| # | Requirement | Action | Priority | Status | Created | Implemented | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Item attribute tracking | New feature_05 | High | PLANNING COMPLETE | 2026-01-04 | Not yet | Ready for implementation (after feature_02) |

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

**Planning Complete:**
- feature_05_injury_tracking spec created (S2 ✅)
- All features re-aligned (S3 ✅)
- Feature test strategy created (S4 ✅)

**Resuming Work:**
- feature_02_projection_system: Resuming S6
  - Resume from: {Exact step where paused}
  - Next action: {Continue implementation}
```

---

### Step 2: Verify No Spec Changes Affect Paused Feature

**Check:**
- Did S3 alignment change paused feature's spec?
- Does new/updated feature change interfaces paused feature uses?
- Do integration points affect paused feature?

---

#### If paused feature's spec WAS changed:

**Inform user:**

```markdown
I've completed planning for the missed requirement (Stages 2/3/4 complete).

During S3 alignment, feature_02's spec was updated:
- Added integration point: Call feature_05.get_attribute_status()
- Updated PlayerData class reference (now uses shared utility)
- Updated projection calculation to account for injury impact

Before resuming implementation, should I:
1. Update feature_02's implementation_plan.md to reflect spec changes
2. Continue with current implementation_plan.md (spec changes are minor/will handle during implementation)

What would you like to do?
```

**If user says update implementation_plan.md:**
- Re-run relevant parts of S5 for affected tasks
- Update implementation plan
- Document changes
- Then resume

---

#### If paused feature's spec was NOT changed:

**Inform user:**

```markdown
Planning complete for missed requirement.

Stages completed:
- S2: feature_05 spec created ✅
- S3: All features aligned ✅
- S4: Feature test strategy created ✅

feature_02's spec remains unchanged. Resuming implementation at S6.
```

---

### Step 3: Resume from Saved State

**Read paused feature's README.md:**

```markdown
## Agent Status (PAUSED - Missed Requirement Handling)

**Resume Instructions:**
When planning complete:
1. Verify this feature's spec still valid after alignment ← DID THIS
2. Resume at: S6 ← RESUME HERE
3. Context: Implementing projection calculation logic ← CONTEXT
```

**Update paused feature's README Agent Status:**

```markdown
## Agent Status (RESUMED)

**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

**Current Phase:** IMPLEMENTATION_EXECUTION (Resumed)
**Current Guide:** stages/s6/s6_execution.md

**Resumed After:** Missed requirement planning complete
- feature_05_injury_tracking spec created and aligned
- Stages 2/3/4 complete for feature_05
- feature_02 spec verified (unchanged/updated)

**Current Stage:** S6 (Implementation Execution)
**Next Action:** Continue S6 execution - Projection calculation logic

**Critical Rules from Guide:**
- Keep spec.md visible during implementation
- Continuous verification against spec
- Mini-QC checkpoints
- 100% test pass required
```

**Continue where you left off**

---

### Step 4: New/Updated Feature Implementation (Later)

**Important:** Don't implement new/updated feature yet!

**Implementation happens later when its turn comes in sequence:**

**Example - Medium Priority:**
```text
Sequence:
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_02 🔄 RESUMED (continue now)
3. feature_05 ◻️ NOT STARTED (implement after feature_02 completes)
4. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED

Current action: Complete feature_02 (S6 → S7 → S8)
After feature_02: Implement feature_05 (S5 → S6 → S7 → S8)
```

**Example - High Priority:**
```bash
Sequence (high priority inserted):
1. feature_01 ✅ COMPLETE
2. feature_05 ◻️ NOT STARTED (implement immediately - blocks feature_02)
3. feature_02 🔄 PAUSED (resume after feature_05 completes)
4. feature_03 ◻️ NOT STARTED
5. feature_04 ◻️ NOT STARTED

Current action: Implement feature_05 (S5 → S6 → S7 → S8)
After feature_05: Resume and complete feature_02
```

**When new/updated feature's turn comes:**
- Run full S5 (S5 → S6 → S7 → S8)
- Same rigor as all features
- No shortcuts

---

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Only Check New/Updated Feature

**Mistake:** "I'll just check the new feature vs others, skip other pairs"

**Why wrong:** New feature may reveal conflicts between existing features

**Correct:** Check ALL feature pairs systematically

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Skip S4

**Mistake:** "Epic test plan doesn't need updates for small feature"

**Why wrong:** Even small features need epic-level test coverage

**Correct:** Always update epic_smoke_test_plan.md

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Implementing Immediately

**Mistake:** After planning, immediately implement new feature before resuming paused work

**Why wrong:** Breaks sequence, paused work left incomplete

**Correct:** Resume paused work, implement new/updated feature when its turn comes

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Not Checking Paused Feature's Spec

**Mistake:** Resume without checking if paused feature's spec changed

**Why wrong:** May be implementing against outdated spec

**Correct:** Always verify paused feature's spec after S3

---

## Next Steps

**After completing PHASE 3 & 4 (Realignment and Resume):**

✅ S3 complete (all features aligned)
✅ S4 complete (epic test plan updated)
✅ Paused feature spec verified
✅ Work resumed OR ready to resume

**Next:**
- If work was paused: Continue paused feature implementation
- If work was not paused: Continue current feature implementation
- Later: When new/updated feature's turn comes, implement through full S5

**Special Case:**
- If discovered during S9/S10: See `missed_requirement/s9_s10_special.md`
