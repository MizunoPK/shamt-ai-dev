# S9 Prompts: Epic Final QC

**Stage:** 9
**Purpose:** Epic-level testing and validation

---

## Starting S9: Epic Final QC

**User says:** "Run epic QC" or "Validate the entire epic" or Agent detects ALL features complete S8.P2

**Prerequisite:** ALL features complete S8.P2, no pending bug fixes

**Agent MUST respond:**

```python
I'm beginning S9 (Epic Final QC).

**Guide I'm following:** stages/s9/s9_epic_final_qc.md (from CLAUDE.md Stage Workflow table)
**Prerequisites verified:**
- [x] Prior stage (S8) fully complete in EPIC_README.md Epic Completion Checklist - all features done S8.P2
- [x] Guide path matches CLAUDE.md Stage Workflow table
- [x] Read ENTIRE guide using Read tool

**The guide requires:**
- **Epic Smoke Testing** (distinct from feature-level testing):
  - Part 1: Epic-level import tests (all features together)
  - Part 2: Epic-level entry point tests
  - Part 3: Epic E2E execution tests (complete workflows with REAL data)
  - Part 4: Cross-feature integration tests (features working together)
  - **CRITICAL:** Verify OUTPUT DATA VALUES (not just structure)
- **Epic-Level QC Validation Loop** (until 3 consecutive clean rounds):
  - Check ALL dimensions every round (7 master + 5 epic-specific = 12 total)
  - 3 consecutive clean rounds required to exit
  - Fix issues immediately and continue (no restart for minor issues)
- **Epic PR Review** (11 categories at EPIC scope):
  - Focus: Architectural consistency across features
  - Review epic-wide changes (not individual features)
- **Validation Against Original Epic Request**:
  - Read ORIGINAL {epic_name}.txt file
  - Verify epic achieves user's goals
  - Validate expected outcomes delivered
- **Use EVOLVED epic_smoke_test_plan.md**:
  - Plan updated in S1 → S4 → S8.P2 (all features)
  - Reflects ACTUAL implementation (not assumptions)
- **Validation Loop approach**:
  - Fix issues immediately (no restart for minor issues)
  - Reset clean counter and continue validation
  - 3 consecutive clean rounds required to exit
  - Major issues (user-reported bugs) may require restart

**Critical Distinction:**
- Feature testing (S7): Tests feature in ISOLATION
- Epic testing (S9): Tests ALL features TOGETHER

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ ALL features show "S8.P2 complete" in EPIC_README.md
  - Feature 01 ({name}): ✅
  - Feature 02 ({name}): ✅
  - {Continue for all features}
✅ No pending bug fixes
✅ epic_smoke_test_plan.md shows recent S8.P2 updates
✅ All unit tests passing (100%)

**I'll now execute the evolved epic_smoke_test_plan.md...**

**Updating EPIC_README.md Agent Status:**
- Current Stage: S9.P1 - Epic Smoke Testing
- Current Guide: stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md
- Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
- Critical Rules: "Use EVOLVED test plan", "Verify OUTPUT DATA VALUES", "4-part smoke testing", "12 dimensions checked every round", "3 consecutive clean rounds required"
- Next Action: Execute Step 1 - Pre-QC Verification

Starting epic smoke testing...
```
