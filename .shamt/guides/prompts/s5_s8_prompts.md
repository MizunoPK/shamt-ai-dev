## Starting S5 v2: Implementation Planning

**User says:** "Prepare for updates based on {feature_name}" or "Start implementation of feature_01" or "Create implementation plan"

**Prerequisite:** S3 complete (Gate 4.5 passed) AND feature spec.md complete AND checklist.md resolved AND Testing Approach (A/B/C/D) set in EPIC_README (S4 is deprecated)

**Note:** S5 v2 uses Validation Loop approach (replaces 22-iteration v1 structure)

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
I'm beginning S5 (Implementation Planning) for {feature_name}.

**Guide I'm following:** stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (from CLAUDE.md Stage Workflow table)
**Prerequisites verified:**
- [x] S3 complete (Gate 4.5 passed — Testing Approach A/B/C/D set in EPIC_README; S4 is deprecated)
- [x] Guide path matches CLAUDE.md Stage Workflow table
- [x] Read ENTIRE guide using Read tool

**The guide requires:**

**Phase 1: Draft Creation (60-90 minutes)**
- Use template: `templates/implementation_plan_template.md`
- Create all 11 dimension sections in implementation_plan.md
- Target: ~70% completeness (known gaps acceptable)
- Time limit: Stop at 90 minutes even if only 70% complete
- Copy VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG_S5_template.md to feature folder

**Phase 2: Validation Loop (3.5-6 hours, typically 6-8 rounds)**
- Validate against 18 dimensions EVERY round (7 master + 11 S5-specific):
- **11 S5-specific dimensions** (create sections in implementation_plan.md):
  1. Requirements Completeness
  2. Interface & Dependency Verification
  3. Algorithm Traceability
  4. Task Specification Quality (embeds Gate 4a)
  5. Data Flow & Consumption
  6. Error Handling & Edge Cases
  7. Integration & Compatibility (embeds Gate 7a)
  8. Test Coverage Quality
  9. Performance & Dependencies
  10. Implementation Readiness
  11. Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation (embeds Gate 23a)
- Fix ALL issues before next round (zero deferred issues)
- Exit when primary clean round achieved, then spawn 2 sub-agents for confirmation
- Document each round in VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md

**🚨 CRITICAL: IMPLEMENTATION TASKS MUST TRACE TO SPEC REQUIREMENTS**:
- Every implementation task must map to explicit spec.md requirement
- Do NOT add tasks based on "best practices" or assumptions
- Do NOT add tasks the user didn't ask for
- If uncertain → document in questions.md

**Interface Verification Protocol**:
- READ actual source code for every dependency
- Do NOT assume interfaces - verify them with file:line references

**Benefits vs S5 v1:**
- 35-50% time reduction (4.5-7 hours vs 9-11 hours)
- No redundancy (v1 had 3x re-verifications)
- Systematic validation (impossible to skip checks)
- Objective quality metric (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation prove completeness)

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ spec.md exists and is complete
✅ checklist.md all items resolved (all [x])
✅ S3 complete (Gate 4.5 passed; S4 deprecated — Testing Approach confirmed in EPIC_README)
✅ No pending questions from S2

**Updating feature README Agent Status:**
- Current Phase: S5_V2_DRAFT_CREATION
- Current Guide: stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md

## Reporting S5 v2: Validation Round Results

**After completing each validation round:**

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
**Validation Round {N} Complete**

**Reading Pattern:** {pattern used}
**Duration:** {X minutes}

**Issues Found:** {count}

{If count > 0:}
| Dimension | Issue | Fix Applied |

## S5 v2: Gate 5 - User Approval of Implementation Plan

**When:** After S5 v2 validation loop achieves primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation

**Prerequisite:** S5 v2 validation loop complete (PASSED), implementation_plan.md validated to 99%+ quality

**🚨 MANDATORY GATE 5 - USER MUST APPROVE implementation_plan.md BEFORE S6**

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
**S5 v2 (Implementation Planning) Complete**

I've completed the validation loop with primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation. implementation_plan.md is ready for your review (~400 lines):

**Key Sections (validated by 11 dimensions):**
- Implementation Tasks (100% requirements coverage, all with acceptance criteria)
- Component Dependencies Matrix (all interfaces verified from source code)
- Algorithm Traceability Matrix (40+ mappings with file:line references)
- Test Strategy (>90% coverage, includes resume/persistence tests)
- Edge Cases and Error Handling (all enumerated with handling strategy)
- Implementation Phasing (4-6 checkpoints with test validation)
- Performance Considerations (regression analysis, optimization strategy)
- Mock Audit Results (all mocks verified against real interfaces)
- Integration Test Plan (3+ real-object tests, no mocks)
- Data Flow & Consumption (verified downstream consumers)
- Spec Alignment (validated against epic notes, epic ticket, spec summary)

**Validation Metrics:**
- Total Rounds: {N}
- Total Time: {X hours Y minutes}
- Issues Found & Fixed: {count}
- Final Quality: 99%+ (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation validation)

**File Location:** `.shamt/epics/SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/feature_{XX}_{name}/implementation_plan.md`

**Please review implementation_plan.md and confirm:**
1. Implementation approach makes sense
2. Phasing is reasonable (4-6 checkpoints)
3. Test coverage is adequate (>90%)
4. No missing requirements
5. All 11 validation dimensions look complete

**Say "approved" to proceed to S6 (Implementation), or request changes.**

**Note:** This is your opportunity to adjust the implementation approach before code is written. The validation loop has ensured 99%+ quality, but you have final approval.
```

## Starting S6: Implementation

**User says:** "Approved" or "Implement the feature" or "Start coding"

**Prerequisite:** User approved implementation_plan.md from S5

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
I'm reading `stages/s6/s6_execution.md` to ensure I follow the implementation workflow...

**The guide requires:**
- **Create implementation_checklist.md** from implementation_plan.md tasks
- **Keep spec.md VISIBLE** at all times (continuous verification)
- **Use implementation_plan.md as PRIMARY reference** (spec.md provides context)
- Execute implementation tasks in order (following Implementation Phasing)
- **Mini-QC checkpoints** after each major component:
  - Run unit tests
  - Verify against spec
- **Run unit tests after each step** (100% pass required)
- **Interface Verification** before integration:
  - Verify interface matches ACTUAL dependency code
  - Do NOT assume - READ the actual source
- NO code-review tone (write production code, not suggestions)
- STOP if stuck or blocked - ask user

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ S5 v2 complete (EPIC_README.md shows Validation Loop passed: primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
✅ Phase 2 (Validation Loop) complete: All 11 dimensions validated
✅ implementation_plan.md exists and user-approved (Gate 5)
✅ questions.md resolved (or documented "no questions")

**I'll now create implementation_checklist.md from implementation_plan.md tasks and begin implementation...**

**Updating feature README Agent Status:**
- Current Phase: IMPLEMENTATION

## Starting S7.P1: Smoke Testing

**User says:** "Validate the implementation" or Agent detects S6 complete

**Prerequisite:** S6 complete (all implementation tasks done, all unit tests passing)

**Agent MUST respond:**

```python
I'm reading `stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md` to ensure I follow the 3-part smoke testing protocol...

**The guide requires:**
- **Part 1: Import Test** (verify module loads without errors)
  - Import all new/modified modules
  - No import errors = pass
- **Part 2: Entry Point Test** (verify script starts correctly)
  - Run with --help flag
  - Verify help text displays correctly
- **Part 3: E2E Execution Test** (CRITICAL - verify OUTPUT DATA VALUES)
  - Run feature with REAL data (not mocks)
  - **Verify ACTUAL DATA VALUES** (not just file existence)
  - Example: df['score'].between(0, 500).all() AND df['projected_value'].sum() > 0
  - BAD: assert Path("output.csv").exists()  # Structure only
  - GOOD: assert df['projected_value'].sum() > 0  # Data values
- **Re-Reading Checkpoint**:
  - After Part 2, re-read "What Passes" criteria
  - After Part 3, re-read DATA VALUES examples
- **MANDATORY GATE**:
  - All 3 parts must pass to proceed to QC rounds
  - If ANY part fails → fix issue and restart smoke testing from Part 1

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ S6 complete (all implementation tasks done)
✅ ALL unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
✅ implementation_checklist.md all items verified (all checked off)

**I'll now begin with Part 1: Import Test...**

**Updating feature README Agent Status:**
- Current Phase: POST_IMPLEMENTATION_SMOKE_TESTING
- Current Guide: stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md
- Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
- Critical Rules: "3 parts MANDATORY", "Verify DATA VALUES not structure", "GATE before QC rounds"
- Progress: 0/3 parts complete
- Next Action: Smoke Test Part 1 - Import test

Running import test for {feature_name}...

**NEXT MANDATORY STEP (when all 3 smoke testing parts pass):**
Use the "Starting S7.P2: Feature QC Validation Loop" prompt before any other action.
Do NOT proceed to S7.P3 or present results to user without completing S7.P2.
```

## Starting S7.P2: Feature QC Validation Loop

**User says:** "Begin QC" or Agent detects smoke testing passed

**Prerequisite:** Smoke testing complete (all 3 parts passed)

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
I'm reading `stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md` and `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md` to follow the Feature QC Validation Loop...

**The guide requires:**
- **Validation Loop Protocol** (extends Master Validation Loop):
  - Check ALL 16 dimensions EVERY round (7 master + 9 S7 QC-specific)
  - Exit when primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation (both confirm zero issues)
  - Fix ALL issues immediately before next round (no deferring)
  - Typical: 3-5 primary rounds to achieve primary clean round

- **16 Dimensions Checked Every Round:**
  - Master (7): Empirical Verification, Completeness, Internal Consistency, Traceability, Clarity & Specificity, Upstream Alignment, Standards Compliance
  - S7 QC (9): Cross-Feature Integration, Error Handling Completeness, End-to-End Functionality, Test Coverage Quality, Requirements Completion, Import & Dependency Hygiene, Cross-Layer & Type Consistency, Input Validation & Path Safety, Test Stub Consistency

- **Key Difference from Old Approach:**
  - OLD: Sequential rounds checking different concerns → Any issue → Restart from S7.P1
  - NEW: All dimensions checked every round → Fix immediately → Continue until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation
  - Time savings: 60-180 min per bug (no restart overhead)

- **Fresh Eyes Every Round:**
  - Take 2-5 minute break between rounds
  - Re-read ENTIRE codebase using Read tool
  - Use different reading patterns (sequential, reverse, spot-checks)

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ Smoke testing complete (all 3 parts passed)
✅ Part 3 verified OUTPUT DATA VALUES (not just structure)
✅ All unit tests passing (100% pass rate)

**I'll now begin Validation Round 1...**

**Updating feature README Agent Status:**
- Current Phase: S7.P2 (Feature QC Validation Loop)

## Starting S8.P1: Cross-Feature Alignment

**User says:** "Review other feature specs" or Agent detects S7 complete

**Prerequisite:** S7 complete (smoke testing passed, QC rounds passed, final review complete)

**Agent MUST respond:**

```markdown
I'm reading `stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md` to ensure I review all remaining feature specs...

**The guide requires:**
- Review ALL remaining features (not yet at S7)
  - Identify remaining features from EPIC_README.md Epic Progress Tracker
- For EACH remaining feature (SEQUENTIAL):
  - Read feature spec.md with fresh eyes
  - Read just-completed feature's ACTUAL code (not plans)
  - Compare spec assumptions to actual implementation
  - Identify misalignments
  - Update spec.md and checklist.md
  - Mark for rework if significant changes needed
- **Significant Rework Criteria:**
  - Return to S1: Feature should be split, or no longer needed
  - Return to S2: Spec assumptions fundamentally wrong
  - Return to S5: >3 new implementation tasks needed, algorithm changes significantly
  - Minor Updates (continue): ≤3 implementation task adjustments, no algorithm changes
- **Compare to ACTUAL implementation** (not the plan from S5)
- Document insights in just-completed feature's spec.md
- Final verification: No remaining features need significant rework

**Why this matters:**
- Implementation reveals reality (assumptions often wrong)
- Prevents cascading issues
- Ensures remaining features align with actual code

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ S7 complete (smoke testing, QC, PR review all passed)
✅ EPIC_README.md shows which features are remaining
✅ Just-completed feature's code accessible for review

**I'll now identify remaining features and review them sequentially...**

**Updating EPIC_README.md Agent Status:**
- Current Stage: S8.P1 - Cross-Feature Alignment
- Current Guide: stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md
- Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
- Critical Rules: "Review ALL remaining features", "Compare to ACTUAL implementation", "Update specs proactively", "Mark features needing significant rework"
- Next Action: Identify remaining features from Epic Progress Tracker

Starting cross-feature alignment review...
```

## Starting S8.P2: Epic Testing Plan Update

**User says:** "Update epic test plan" or Agent detects S8.P1 complete

**Prerequisite:** S8.P1 complete (all remaining feature specs reviewed and updated)

**Agent MUST respond:**

```bash
I'm reading `stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md` to ensure I update the epic test plan based on actual implementation...

**The guide requires:**
- Review ACTUAL implementation of just-completed feature:
  - Read actual code (not just plans)
  - Identify actual interfaces created
  - Note actual data structures used
  - Find integration points with other features
- Compare to current epic_smoke_test_plan.md:
  - Identify gaps (implementation vs plan)
  - Find scenarios that need updating
  - Discover new integration points
- Update epic_smoke_test_plan.md:
  - Add new test scenarios based on actual implementation
  - Update existing scenarios if needed
  - Add integration point tests (cross-feature)
  - Update "Last Updated" timestamp
  - Add entry to Update History table
- **Focus on ACTUAL implementation**:
  - Not what was PLANNED
  - What was ACTUALLY built
- Test plan evolves incrementally:
  - S1: Placeholder
  - S5 Step 0: Test Scope Decision (S4 deprecated)
  - S8.P2: Based on actual implementation (THIS stage)
  - S9: Execute evolved plan

**Why this matters:**
- Implementation often differs from specs
- New integration points discovered during coding
- Test plan must reflect REALITY for S9 to be effective

**Prerequisites I'm verifying:**
✅ S8.P1 complete (all remaining features reviewed)
✅ Just-completed feature fully implemented and QC'd
✅ epic_smoke_test_plan.md accessible

**I'll now review the actual implementation and identify test plan updates...**

**Updating EPIC_README.md Agent Status:**
- Current Stage: S8.P2 - Epic Testing Plan Update
- Current Guide: stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md
- Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
- Critical Rules: "Review ACTUAL implementation", "Add integration scenarios", "Update History table", "Test plan evolves incrementally"
- Next Action: Read just-completed feature's actual code to identify test plan updates

Starting test plan update...
