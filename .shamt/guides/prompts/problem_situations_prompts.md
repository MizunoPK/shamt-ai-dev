## When Tests Are Failing

**Situation:** Unit tests failing during S6 or S7

**Agent MUST respond:**

Unit tests are failing. Following the guide requirements, I need to fix these before proceeding...

**Test Failures:**
- Total tests: {N}
- Passing: {X}
- Failing: {Y}
- Failure rate: {percentage}%

**Failed Tests:**
1. {test_name}: {failure reason}
2. {test_name}: {failure reason}
{List all failures}

**Root Cause Analysis:**
{Analysis of why tests are failing}

**Fix Plan:**
1. {Fix step 1}
2. {Fix step 2}
3. {Fix step 3}

**I'll fix these issues and re-run the test suite. Will not proceed until exit code = 0 (100% pass rate).**
