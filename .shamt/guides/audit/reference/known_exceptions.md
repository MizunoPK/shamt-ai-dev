# Known Exceptions - Prerequisites/Exit Criteria

**Purpose:** Documents files that intentionally lack formal "## Prerequisites" or "## Exit Criteria" sections

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

**Why This Document Exists:**
Audit Dimension D8 (Documentation Quality) checks for "## Prerequisites" and "## Exit Criteria" sections in workflow guides. However, certain file types intentionally use alternative patterns. This document prevents these files from being flagged as violations in future audits.

---

## Exception Categories

### Category A: S5 Iteration Files (14 files)

**Pattern:** Lightweight iteration guides with inline prerequisites, exit criteria inherited from parent round

**⚠️ NOTE: All 14 files in this category have been DELETED from the filesystem** as part of the S5 v1 → S5 v2 migration. S5 v2 consolidates all iteration content into a single `s5_v2_validation_loop.md` file using an 11-dimension Validation Loop approach. These entries are retained for historical reference only — they cannot produce D8 false positives since the files no longer exist.

**Design Rationale (historical):**
- Iteration files were sequential steps within S5 v1 rounds (Round 1, Round 2, Round 3)
- Prerequisites were simple: "Previous iteration complete" (stated inline)
- Exit criteria defined at round level (s5_v2_validation_loop.md consolidates all rounds)
- Formal sections would have been redundant
- Files followed "router + detailed iteration" pattern for focused reference

**Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (inline instead), Exit Criteria (inherited from parent)

**Files (DELETED — S5 v1 only, no longer in filesystem):**

#### S5.P1 (Round 1) Iteration Files (7 files)

1. **stages/s5/s5_p1_i3_integration.md**
   - Type: Router for Iterations 5-7
   - Prerequisites: Line 8 - "**Prerequisites:** Iterations 1-4 + Gate 4a complete"

    - Type: S5 v1 Iteration 22 - Consumers (now Dimension 10)
    - Prerequisites: Inline statement
    - Exit Criteria: Inherited from s5_v2_validation_loop.md
    - Design: Focused single-iteration guide (S5 v1 only)

**Audit Action:** SKIP these files when checking D8 (Documentation Quality) - Prerequisites/Exit Criteria

---

### Category B: S5 Design and Migration Documents (INACTIVE — files deleted)

**Pattern:** Design plans and migration guides (not workflow execution guides)

**Status:** These 2 files no longer exist in the repository. The S5 v1→v2 migration guide and S5 v2 design plan were deleted during S5 cleanup. This exception category is now inactive.

**Historical Note:** These were reference documents for the S5 v1 (22 iterations) → S5 v2 (Validation Loop) transition. The files lacked Prerequisites/Exit Criteria by design (not workflow execution guides).

**Audit Action:** No action needed — files do not exist, exception is inactive.

---

### Category C: Optional/Auxiliary Files (4 files)

**Pattern:** Support guides used conditionally or as reference material, not standard sequential workflows

**Design Rationale:**
- Files serve specific auxiliary purposes
- Prerequisites/exit criteria handled inline or not applicable
- Not part of standard epic workflow sequence

**Files:**

15. **stages/s3/s3_parallel_work_sync.md**
    - **Type:** Optional synchronization checklist
    - **When Used:** Only when S2 executed in parallel mode (Primary + Secondary agents)
    - **Skipped:** When S2 done sequentially (single agent)
    - **Prerequisites:** None (conditional usage based on S2 execution mode)
    - **Exit Criteria:** Inline completion verification in Step 0.2 - STATUS file checks
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (not applicable), Exit Criteria (inline instead)
    - **Design Rationale:** Conditional auxiliary workflow, not standard stage progression
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP - not a standard workflow guide

16. **stages/s4/archive/s4_feature_testing_card.md** *(ARCHIVED — SHAMT-7)*
    - **Type:** Quick reference card / cheat sheet
    - **Status:** Archived. S4 deprecated in SHAMT-6; files moved to archive/ in SHAMT-7.
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP — archived file, not in active guide tree

17. **stages/s4/archive/s4_test_strategy_development.md** *(ARCHIVED — SHAMT-7)*
    - **Type:** Detailed iteration guide (Iterations 1-3)
    - **Status:** Archived. S4 deprecated in SHAMT-6; files moved to archive/ in SHAMT-7.
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP — archived file, not in active guide tree

18. **stages/s4/s4_feature_testing_strategy.md** *(Added — SHAMT-7)*
    - **Type:** Deprecation redirect stub
    - **When Used:** Agents encountering S4 guidance are redirected here
    - **Status:** Active (redirect only — not a workflow guide)
    - **Prerequisites:** Not applicable (redirect stub, not a workflow stage)
    - **Exit Criteria:** Not applicable (redirect stub with "Proceed To" pointer to S5)
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites, Exit Criteria (neither apply to redirect stubs)
    - **Design Rationale:** Redirect stubs exist only to point agents/users to the replacement. Requiring formal Prerequisites/Exit Criteria would add confusing structure to a one-purpose document.
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP — deprecation redirect, not a workflow guide

### Category D: Emoji Heading Anchor Patterns

**Purpose:** Documents the correct GFM anchor format for headings that start with emoji.

**Why anchors look "wrong" but are correct:**
GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) strips emoji characters during anchor generation. A heading like
`## 🔢 Understanding Gate Numbering` produces anchor `#-understanding-gate-numbering`, NOT
`#🔢-understanding-gate-numbering`. The leading hyphen comes from the space character that
follows the emoji (space → hyphen after stripping the emoji).

**Pattern:** `#-kebab-case-title` is correct for all emoji-prefixed headings.

**🚨 Do NOT "fix" these anchors** — they are already correct. Changing them from `#-name` to
`#emoji-name` is a regression (introduced in Round 12 SR12.3 and reverted in Round 13).

**Verified correct anchors:**

| File | Heading | Correct Anchor | Wrong Form (do not use) |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| `reference/mandatory_gates.md` | `## 🔢 Understanding Gate Numbering` | `#-understanding-gate-numbering` | `#🔢-understanding-gate-numbering` |
| `stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md` | `## 🔀 Parallel Work Check (FIRST PRIORITY)` | `#-parallel-work-check-first-priority` | `#🔀-parallel-work-check-first-priority` |
| `stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md` | `## 📖 Terminology Note` | `#-terminology-note` | `#📖-terminology-note` |
| `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` | `## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL` | `#-mandatory-reading-protocol` | `#🚨-mandatory-reading-protocol` |
| `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` | `## 🛑 Critical Rules` | `#-critical-rules` | `#🛑-critical-rules` |

**Algorithm (for deriving anchors for new emoji headings):**
1. Take heading text, lowercase it
2. Strip all non-alphanumeric, non-space, non-hyphen characters (including the emoji)
3. Replace spaces with hyphens — the space after the stripped emoji becomes a leading `-`
4. Do not trim leading hyphens — `#-name` is valid

**Related:** See D10 Context-Sensitive Rule 5 for full specification.

## Category E: Pre-Audit Script Recurring False Positives

**Purpose:** Documents recurring false positives from `pre_audit_checks.sh` that are not covered by the D12 Prerequisites/Exit Criteria check above. These appear every run and must be excluded from fix counts.

---

### E1: D8 TODO/Placeholder Instances (27 Critical)

**Dimension:** D8 (Documentation Quality)
**Check:** `pre_audit_checks.sh` TODO/placeholder scan
**Every-run count:** 27 critical, ~35 placeholder matches

**Root Cause:** The D8 check scans all of `.shamt/guides/` including the epic workflow stage guides (s1–s10). Those guides intentionally contain TODO/TBD/placeholder text as instructional examples and checklist items — they teach users to avoid placeholders, so they must reference them.

**Affected files:**
- `stages/s1/s1_p3_discovery_phase.md` — mentions "TBD" as example of vague description to avoid
- `stages/s1/s1_epic_planning.md` — template showing `Integration Test Convention: [TBD — will be set in S5]` and `End Date: (TBD — fill in at S10)` as instructional examples
- `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` — "zero questions remain 'UNKNOWN', 'TBD'" as exit criterion
- `stages/s3/s3_epic_planning_approval.md` — checklist item: "no TBD" as acceptance criterion
- `stages/s5/s5_bugfix_workflow.md` — "Bug Fix TODO: Authentication Error" as a template example
- `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md` — "no TBD" completeness check
- `stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md` — "NO TODOs" as QC requirement (x2 lines)
- `stages/s7/s7_p3_final_review.md` — "Check: No 'TODO' comments" as review criterion
- `stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md` — "Don't compare to original TODO or plan" (meta-content)
- `stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md` — "Don't rely on specs or TODO list" / "not specs/TODOs" (meta-content, x2 lines)
- `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` — "No placeholder text (e.g., 'TODO', '{fill in later}')" as checklist
- (multiple reference/ files — glossary, faq, stage_5 ref card, validation loop guides — all meta-content examples)

**Why acceptable:** All occurrences are meta-content: teaching that real work products must not have TODOs. The stage guides themselves have no incomplete sections. The text is definitionally required to describe the standard.

**Action:** When pre_audit_checks.sh reports "TODOs remaining: 27" — this is the expected baseline. Only investigate if the count rises above 27 or if new files appear in the list.

**Note:** Baseline updated from 23 → 24 on 2026-03-07; updated 24 → 25 on 2026-03-14; updated 25 → 27 on 2026-03-30 after SHAMT-20 audit confirmed `stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md` and `stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md` contribute meta-content TODO references added by SHAMT-20 changes. Full affected-file list updated to include all 27 files.

---

### E2: D10 Prerequisite-Content Conflicts (2 Warnings)

**Dimension:** D10 (Prerequisite-Content Consistency)
**Check:** `pre_audit_checks.sh` prerequisite-content conflict scan
**Every-run count:** 2 warnings, always the same file

**Root Cause:** `stages/s2/s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md` uses a group-based parallel work pattern where prerequisites define "all features completed S2.P1" but the content describes running on each group after its Group 1 features complete S2.P1. This is correct and intentional — it's a phased parallel execution model, not an inconsistency.

**Affected file:**
- `stages/s2/s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md` — appears twice in the conflict list (same file, two different pattern matches)

**Why acceptable:** The prerequisite says "all features in current group completed S2.P1" and the content describes exactly that pattern applied per-group. The check misidentifies the scoping language as a conflict.

**Action:** When pre_audit_checks.sh reports "Found 2 potential prerequisite-content conflicts" pointing at s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md — expected baseline. Only investigate if new files appear in the conflict list.

### Category E (continued): D12 Companion/Reference Files in stages/

**Purpose:** Documents companion files co-located with their parent guide in a `stages/` directory. These are reference/example materials, not sequential workflow guides, and intentionally lack formal Prerequisites/Exit/Overview sections.

**Design Rationale:**
- Companion files (examples, troubleshooting guides) live alongside their parent guide for discoverability
- They are reference material — consulted as needed, not executed linearly
- Adding formal Prerequisites/Exit Criteria would add confusing structure to one-purpose documents

**Files:**

19. **stages/s5/s5_v2_example.md** *(Added — child-sync-20260326)*
    - **Type:** Worked example — illustrates a complete S5 v2 validation loop execution
    - **Parent Guide:** `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md`
    - **Prerequisites:** Not applicable — reference material, not a workflow stage
    - **Exit Criteria:** Not applicable — reference illustration only
    - **Overview:** Replaced by `**Purpose:**` front-matter header (line 4)
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites, Exit Criteria, Overview (all not applicable)
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP D12 — companion reference file, not a sequential guide

20. **stages/s5/s5_v2_troubleshooting.md** *(Added — child-sync-20260326)*
    - **Type:** Troubleshooting reference — common issues, fixes, and anti-patterns for S5 v2
    - **Parent Guide:** `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md`
    - **Prerequisites:** Not applicable — reference material, consulted as needed
    - **Exit Criteria:** Not applicable — reference lookup, not a workflow stage
    - **Overview:** Replaced by `**Purpose:**` front-matter header (line 4)
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites, Exit Criteria, Overview (all not applicable)
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP D12 — companion reference file, not a sequential guide

---

## Category F: D11 Pre-Existing File Size Exceptions

**Purpose:** Documents stage guide files that exceed the 1250-line D11 baseline but cannot be split within the current SHAMT work scope. These require a dedicated file-splitting SHAMT-N.

**Design Rationale:**
- Both files are primary stage guides that consolidate what used to be multiple smaller files
- They were already over the 1250-line threshold before SHAMT-7 (which added only 4–14 lines each)
- Proper splitting requires creating router files + sub-files + updating all cross-references — a separate refactoring scope

**Files:**

**F1. stages/s1/s1_epic_planning.md (1394 lines)**
- **D11 Status:** Exceeds 1250-line baseline by 144 lines
- **Pre-existing:** Yes — was 1304 lines before SHAMT-9 (~28 lines); SHAMT-20 added ~62 more lines (P2 S3 overlap note, P6 Gate 1.5, P8 S3 early start, P9 metrics references)
- **Split candidates:** S1.P1–P3 are each large enough to warrant standalone files
- **Why deferred:** Splitting requires updating all "read s1_epic_planning.md" references across the guide tree; out of SHAMT-20 scope
- **Audit Action:** SKIP D11 violation — tracked for future file-splitting SHAMT-N

**F2. stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (1397 lines)**
- **D11 Status:** Exceeds 1250-line baseline by 147 lines
- **Pre-existing:** Yes — was 1327 lines before SHAMT-9; SHAMT-20 added ~5 more lines (secondary agent guide references)
- **Split candidates:** Phase 1 (Draft), Phase 2 (Validation Loop), dimension reference sections
- **Why deferred:** Splitting requires updating all "read s5_v2_validation_loop.md" references and agent prompts; out of SHAMT-20 scope
- **Audit Action:** SKIP D11 violation — tracked for future file-splitting SHAMT-N

**F3. reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md (1582 lines)**
- **D11 Status:** Exceeds 1250-line baseline by 332 lines
- **Pre-existing:** Yes — consolidated master protocol predates SHAMT-7; grew to 1582 lines through SHAMT-20 additions
- **Split candidates:** Could be split into protocol core + dimension-specific appendices
- **Why deferred:** This is the central reference document for all validation loop scenarios; splitting requires updating all scenario files (`validation_loop_*.md`) that defer to it; out of SHAMT-7 scope
- **Note:** `pre_audit_checks.sh` does not scan `reference/` for D11, so this exception is for manual audit rounds only
- **Audit Action:** SKIP D11 violation — tracked for future file-splitting SHAMT-N

## Category G: D22 Lightweight MRP Exceptions (Router and Optional Guides)

**Purpose:** Documents guides that have lightweight MRP (missing FS block) as an intentional design choice.

**D22 Context:** Dimension 22 (Guide Bypass Risk) requires three enforcement mechanisms: MRP with resumption clause, FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS block, and phase commitment gates. For router guides and optional conditional guides, FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS are not applicable because there are no procedural steps that could be skipped — the entire guide IS the routing decision or check.

**Files:**

**G1. stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md** *(Added SHAMT-11 audit)*
- **Type:** Router guide
- **MRP:** Present (lightweight — added SHAMT-11 audit) with resumption clause
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — guide contains routing decision logic only (parallel work check, phase navigation); no procedural steps to shortcut
- **Audit Action:** PASS D22 — lightweight MRP is the correct pattern for router guides

**G2. stages/s9/s9_epic_final_qc.md** *(Added SHAMT-11 audit)*
- **Type:** Router guide
- **MRP:** Present (lightweight — added SHAMT-11 audit) with resumption clause
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — guide contains routing decision logic only (sub-stage navigation, single-feature shortcut); no procedural steps to shortcut
- **Audit Action:** PASS D22 — lightweight MRP is the correct pattern for router guides

**G3. stages/s3/s3_parallel_work_sync.md** *(Added SHAMT-11 audit)*
- **Type:** Optional conditional guide (only when S2 executed in parallel mode)
- **MRP:** Present (lightweight — added SHAMT-11 audit) with resumption clause
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not present — guide is short (265 lines) and has explicit "Skip this" instructions at the top; FS would be redundant
- **Audit Action:** PASS D22 — lightweight MRP sufficient for optional auxiliary guides

**G4. stages/s4/s4_feature_testing_strategy.md** *(Added SHAMT-11 audit)*
- **Type:** Deprecation redirect stub
- **MRP:** Not present — redirect stub only; no workflow steps to read or follow
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — redirect stubs have no procedural steps
- **Design Rationale:** Redirect stubs exist only to point agents to the replacement (stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md). Requiring MRP/FS would add confusing structure to a one-purpose document.
- **Audit Action:** SKIP D22 — deprecation redirect stub, not a workflow guide

**G5. stages/s10/s10_p2_overview_workflow.md** *(Added SHAMT-20 audit)*
- **Type:** Optional workflow guide (user opt-in phase)
- **MRP:** Present as `🔔 OPTIONAL READING PROTOCOL` (not MANDATORY) — includes Read tool instruction and resumption clause; "OPTIONAL" signals the opt-in nature of the phase
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Present with guide-specific items (Step 1 and Step 3)
- **Design Rationale:** S10.P2 is intentionally opt-in — users must be asked before the agent proceeds. Using MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL would be misleading for a guide the agent should only read if the user opts in. The OPTIONAL READING PROTOCOL preserves the same content requirements (Read tool, resumption) while signaling the phase is conditional.
- **Audit Action:** PASS D22 — ORP with resumption clause + guide-specific FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS provides adequate bypass resistance for an optional guide

---

## Category H: D12 MRP Exceptions (parallel_work/ Guides)

**Purpose:** Documents all guides in `parallel_work/` that intentionally omit MRP. `pre_audit_checks.sh` intentionally does not scan `parallel_work/` for D12, reflecting this design intent.

**D12 Context:** Dimension 12 (Mandatory Reading Protocol) requires all stage guides to have MRP. `parallel_work/` guides are not stage guides — they fall into two types: (1) secondary agent task prompts passed via the Task tool (the guide IS the agent's task, so MRP is redundant); (2) primary agent coordination references read during parallel execution (coordination reference material, not stage entry points where bypass risk exists).

**Files:**

**H1. parallel_work/s2_secondary_agent_guide.md** *(Added SHAMT-20 audit)*
- **Type:** Task-spawned secondary agent guide (S2 parallel work)
- **MRP:** Not present — guide is the Task tool prompt itself; secondary agents receive it as their complete task context, not as a browsable guide
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — guide is a complete task description, not a navigable workflow with skippable sections
- **Design Rationale:** Secondary agents are spawned via Task tool with this guide as their task. They cannot "skip" reading it — it IS their task. MRP enforcement would be redundant and confusing.
- **Audit Action:** PASS D12 — task-spawned design eliminates MRP requirement

**H2. parallel_work/s5_secondary_agent_guide.md** *(Added SHAMT-20 audit)*
- **Type:** Task-spawned secondary agent guide (S5 parallel work)
- **MRP:** Not present — same rationale as H1
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — same rationale as H1
- **Design Rationale:** Same as H1.
- **Audit Action:** PASS D12 — task-spawned design eliminates MRP requirement

**H3. parallel_work/s2_primary_agent_guide.md** *(Added SHAMT-20 audit, Round 8)*
- **Type:** Primary agent coordination reference guide (S2 parallel work)
- **MRP:** Not present — guide is a parallel work coordination reference, not a stage entry point; primary agent reads it during parallel execution, not as a browsable workflow guide
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — coordination reference, not a sequential workflow with skippable phases
- **Design Rationale:** `parallel_work/` guides are intentionally excluded from D12 automated checks by `pre_audit_checks.sh`. Primary agent coordination guides are reference material for managing parallel execution — they do not represent stage transitions where MRP bypass risk exists.
- **Audit Action:** PASS D12 — parallel_work/ coordination reference, not a stage guide

**H4. parallel_work/s5_primary_agent_guide.md** *(Added SHAMT-20 audit, Round 8)*
- **Type:** Primary agent coordination reference guide (S5 parallel work)
- **MRP:** Not present — same rationale as H3
- **FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS:** Not applicable — same rationale as H3
- **Design Rationale:** Same as H3.
- **Audit Action:** PASS D12 — parallel_work/ coordination reference, not a stage guide

## How to Use This Document

### For Future Audits

**When running D8 (Documentation Quality) Prerequisites/Exit Criteria checks:**

1. **Generate violation list** using automated pattern search
2. **Cross-reference with this document** before flagging as issues
3. **Filter out known exceptions** (see Summary Statistics for current counts; Categories C–H active)
4. **Investigate remaining violations** as potential real issues

**When running `pre_audit_checks.sh` and seeing recurring script output:**

- "TODOs remaining: 27" — expected baseline; see Category E1 above
- "Found 2 potential prerequisite-content conflicts" pointing at s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md — expected; see Category E2 above
- "⚠️ CLAUDE.md found but no stage references detected" — known script integer-parsing bug (line 370); not a real issue

**Example Audit Workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Find files missing Prerequisites
for file in stages/*/*.md; do
  grep -q "^## Prerequisites" "$file" || echo "$file"
done > missing_prereqs.txt

# Step 2: Filter out known exceptions
# Remove lines matching: s5/s5_p1_i3_*, s5/s5_p3_i1_*, s3/s3_parallel_work_sync.md, s4/s4_feature_testing_card.md, s4/s4_test_strategy_development.md
grep -v -E "(s5_p1_i3_|s5_p3_i1_|s3_parallel_work_sync|s4_feature_testing_card|s4_test_strategy_development)" missing_prereqs.txt > real_violations.txt

# Step 3: Investigate remaining files
wc -l real_violations.txt  # Should be low count
```

### For Guide Authors

**When creating new iteration guides in S5:**
- Use inline prerequisites: "**Prerequisites:** Previous iterations complete"
- Rely on parent round guide for exit criteria
- Follow established pattern (see Category A files above)
- File size: Keep focused and lightweight (100-400 lines)

**When creating auxiliary/optional guides:**
- Consider if Prerequisites/Exit Criteria apply
- If guide is conditional or reference material, inline may be appropriate
- Add entry to this document if creating new exception pattern

**When creating standard workflow guides:**
- **DO include formal "## Prerequisites" section** (h2 level)
- **DO include formal "## Exit Criteria" section** (h2 level)
- Exceptions are rare - default to formal sections

**Last Verified:** 2026-03-30 (updated three times: first pass — E1 baseline 25 → 27, F1/F2/F3 line counts, G5 added for s10_p2_overview_workflow.md; second pass — Category H added for parallel_work secondary agent guides; third pass — H3/H4 added for primary agent guides, Category H title broadened to cover all parallel_work/ guides)
**Next Review:** When new stage/iteration guides added, or if D8/D10/D22 check patterns change
