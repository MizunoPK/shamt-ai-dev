# Known Exceptions - Prerequisites/Exit Criteria

**Purpose:** Documents files that intentionally lack formal "## Prerequisites" or "## Exit Criteria" sections

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-22

**Why This Document Exists:**
Audit Dimension D8 (Documentation Quality) checks for "## Prerequisites" and "## Exit Criteria" sections in workflow guides. However, certain file types intentionally use alternative patterns. This document prevents these files from being flagged as violations in future audits.

---

## Exception Categories

### Category A: S5 Iteration Files (14 files)

**Pattern:** Lightweight iteration guides with inline prerequisites, exit criteria inherited from parent round

**⚠️ NOTE: All 14 files in this category have been DELETED from the filesystem** as part of the S5 v1 → S5 v2 migration. S5 v2 consolidates all iteration content into a single `s5_v2_validation_loop.md` file using an 11-dimension Validation Loop approach. These entries are retained for historical reference only — they cannot produce D8 false positives since the files no longer exist.

**Design Rationale (historical):**
- Iteration files were sequential steps within S5 v1 rounds (Round 1, Round 2, Round 3)
- Prerequisites were simple: "Previous iteration complete" (stated inline)
- Exit criteria defined at round level (s5_v2_validation_loop.md consolidates all rounds)
- Formal sections would have been redundant
- Files followed "router + detailed iteration" pattern for focused reference

**Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (inline instead), Exit Criteria (inherited from parent)

**Files (DELETED — S5 v1 only, no longer in filesystem):**

#### S5.P1 (Round 1) Iteration Files (7 files)

**Audit Action:** SKIP these files when checking D8 (Documentation Quality) - Prerequisites/Exit Criteria

---

### Category B: S5 Design and Migration Documents (INACTIVE — files deleted)

**Pattern:** Design plans and migration guides (not workflow execution guides)

**Status:** These 2 files no longer exist in the repository. The S5 v1→v2 migration guide and S5 v2 design plan were deleted during S5 cleanup. This exception category is now inactive.

**Historical Note:** These were reference documents for the S5 v1 (22 iterations) → S5 v2 (Validation Loop) transition. The files lacked Prerequisites/Exit Criteria by design (not workflow execution guides).

**Audit Action:** No action needed — files do not exist, exception is inactive.

---

### Category C: Optional/Auxiliary Files (3 files)

**Pattern:** Support guides used conditionally or as reference material, not standard sequential workflows

**Design Rationale:**
- Files serve specific auxiliary purposes
- Prerequisites/exit criteria handled inline or not applicable
- Not part of standard epic workflow sequence

**Files:**

15. **stages/s3/s3_parallel_work_sync.md**
    - **Type:** Optional synchronization checklist
    - **When Used:** Only when S2 executed in parallel mode (Primary + Secondary agents)
    - **Skipped:** When S2 done sequentially (single agent)
    - **Prerequisites:** None (conditional usage based on S2 execution mode)
    - **Exit Criteria:** Inline completion verification in Step 0.2 - STATUS file checks
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (not applicable), Exit Criteria (inline instead)
    - **Design Rationale:** Conditional auxiliary workflow, not standard stage progression
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP - not a standard workflow guide

16. **stages/s4/s4_feature_testing_card.md**
    - **Type:** Quick reference card / cheat sheet
    - **Purpose:** At-a-glance iteration checklist for S4
    - **Full Guides:** References s4_feature_testing_strategy.md, s4_test_strategy_development.md
    - **Prerequisites:** Line 13 inline - "**Prerequisites:** S3 complete (Gate 4.5 passed), spec.md finalized (Gate 3 passed)"
    - **Exit Criteria:** Not applicable (reference card, not workflow)
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (inline instead), Exit Criteria (not applicable)
    - **Design Rationale:** Reference material for quick lookup, not step-by-step workflow execution
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP - reference card, not workflow guide

17. **stages/s4/s4_test_strategy_development.md**
    - **Type:** Detailed iteration guide (Iterations 1-3)
    - **Purpose:** Deep-dive instructions for S4 Iterations 1-3
    - **Prerequisites:** Handled in MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL (line 8) - "Verify S4 router guide already read, Verify prerequisites complete (S3 done, Gate 4.5 passed)"
    - **Exit Criteria:** HAS formal "## Exit Criteria" section at line 768
    - **Missing Sections:** Prerequisites (handled in MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL instead of separate h2 section)
    - **Design Rationale:** Prerequisites verification integrated into reading protocol for consistency
    - **Audit Action:** SKIP for Prerequisites check (has Exit Criteria, Prerequisites in protocol)
    - **Note:** This is an audit FALSE POSITIVE - file has Exit Criteria but was flagged by Round 2 audit

### Category D: Emoji Heading Anchor Patterns

**Purpose:** Documents the correct GFM anchor format for headings that start with emoji.

**Why anchors look "wrong" but are correct:**
GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) strips emoji characters during anchor generation. A heading like
`## 🔢 Understanding Gate Numbering` produces anchor `#-understanding-gate-numbering`, NOT
`#🔢-understanding-gate-numbering`. The leading hyphen comes from the space character that
follows the emoji (space → hyphen after stripping the emoji).

**Pattern:** `#-kebab-case-title` is correct for all emoji-prefixed headings.

**🚨 Do NOT "fix" these anchors** — they are already correct. Changing them from `#-name` to
`#emoji-name` is a regression (introduced in Round 12 SR12.3 and reverted in Round 13).

**Verified correct anchors:**

| File | Heading | Correct Anchor | Wrong Form (do not use) |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| `reference/mandatory_gates.md` | `## 🔢 Understanding Gate Numbering` | `#-understanding-gate-numbering` | `#🔢-understanding-gate-numbering` |
| `stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md` | `## 🔀 Parallel Work Check (FIRST PRIORITY)` | `#-parallel-work-check-first-priority` | `#🔀-parallel-work-check-first-priority` |
| `stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md` | `## 📖 Terminology Note` | `#-terminology-note` | `#📖-terminology-note` |
| `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` | `## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL` | `#-mandatory-reading-protocol` | `#🚨-mandatory-reading-protocol` |
| `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` | `## 🛑 Critical Rules` | `#-critical-rules` | `#🛑-critical-rules` |

**Algorithm (for deriving anchors for new emoji headings):**
1. Take heading text, lowercase it
2. Strip all non-alphanumeric, non-space, non-hyphen characters (including the emoji)
3. Replace spaces with hyphens — the space after the stripped emoji becomes a leading `-`
4. Do not trim leading hyphens — `#-name` is valid

**Related:** See D10 Context-Sensitive Rule 5 for full specification.

## Category E: Pre-Audit Script Recurring False Positives

**Purpose:** Documents recurring false positives from `pre_audit_checks.sh` that are not covered by the D12 Prerequisites/Exit Criteria check above. These appear every run and must be excluded from fix counts.

---

### E1: D8 TODO/Placeholder Instances (23 Critical)

**Dimension:** D8 (Documentation Quality)
**Check:** `pre_audit_checks.sh` TODO/placeholder scan
**Every-run count:** 23 critical, ~35 placeholder matches

**Root Cause:** The D8 check scans all of `.shamt/guides/` including the epic workflow stage guides (s1–s10). Those guides intentionally contain TODO/TBD/placeholder text as instructional examples and checklist items — they teach users to avoid placeholders, so they must reference them.

**Affected files:**
- `stages/s1/s1_p3_discovery_phase.md` — mentions "TBD" as example of vague description to avoid
- `stages/s3/s3_epic_planning_approval.md` — checklist item: "no TBD" as acceptance criterion
- `stages/s5/s5_bugfix_workflow.md` — "Bug Fix TODO: Authentication Error" as a template example
- `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md` — "no TBD" completeness check
- `stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md` — "NO TODOs" as QC requirement (×2 lines)
- `stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md` — "No placeholder text (e.g., 'TODO', '{fill in later}')" as checklist

**Why acceptable:** All occurrences are meta-content: teaching that real work products must not have TODOs. The stage guides themselves have no incomplete sections. The text is definitionally required to describe the standard.

**Action:** When pre_audit_checks.sh reports "TODOs remaining: 23" — this is the expected baseline. Only investigate if the count rises above 23 or if new files appear in the list.

---

### E2: D10 Prerequisite-Content Conflicts (2 Warnings)

**Dimension:** D10 (Prerequisite-Content Consistency)
**Check:** `pre_audit_checks.sh` prerequisite-content conflict scan
**Every-run count:** 2 warnings, always the same file

**Root Cause:** `stages/s2/s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md` uses a group-based parallel work pattern where prerequisites define "all features completed S2.P1" but the content describes running on each group after its Group 1 features complete S2.P1. This is correct and intentional — it's a phased parallel execution model, not an inconsistency.

**Affected file:**
- `stages/s2/s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md` — appears twice in the conflict list (same file, two different pattern matches)

**Why acceptable:** The prerequisite says "all features in current group completed S2.P1" and the content describes exactly that pattern applied per-group. The check misidentifies the scoping language as a conflict.

**Action:** When pre_audit_checks.sh reports "Found 2 potential prerequisite-content conflicts" pointing at s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md — expected baseline. Only investigate if new files appear in the conflict list.

## How to Use This Document

### For Future Audits

**When running D8 (Documentation Quality) Prerequisites/Exit Criteria checks:**

1. **Generate violation list** using automated pattern search
2. **Cross-reference with this document** before flagging as issues
3. **Filter out known exceptions** (19 files total — Categories A–D)
4. **Investigate remaining violations** as potential real issues

**When running `pre_audit_checks.sh` and seeing recurring script output:**

- "TODOs remaining: 23" — expected baseline; see Category E1 above
- "Found 2 potential prerequisite-content conflicts" pointing at s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md — expected; see Category E2 above
- "⚠️ CLAUDE.md found but no stage references detected" — known script integer-parsing bug (line 370); not a real issue

**Example Audit Workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Find files missing Prerequisites
for file in stages/*/*.md; do
  grep -q "^## Prerequisites" "$file" || echo "$file"
done > missing_prereqs.txt

# Step 2: Filter out known exceptions
# Remove lines matching: s5/s5_p1_i3_*, s5/s5_p3_i1_*, s3/s3_parallel_work_sync.md, s4/s4_feature_testing_card.md, s4/s4_test_strategy_development.md
grep -v -E "(s5_p1_i3_|s5_p3_i1_|s3_parallel_work_sync|s4_feature_testing_card|s4_test_strategy_development)" missing_prereqs.txt > real_violations.txt

# Step 3: Investigate remaining files
wc -l real_violations.txt  # Should be low count
```

### For Guide Authors

**When creating new iteration guides in S5:**
- Use inline prerequisites: "**Prerequisites:** Previous iterations complete"
- Rely on parent round guide for exit criteria
- Follow established pattern (see Category A files above)
- File size: Keep focused and lightweight (100-400 lines)

**When creating auxiliary/optional guides:**
- Consider if Prerequisites/Exit Criteria apply
- If guide is conditional or reference material, inline may be appropriate
- Add entry to this document if creating new exception pattern

**When creating standard workflow guides:**
- **DO include formal "## Prerequisites" section** (h2 level)
- **DO include formal "## Exit Criteria" section** (h2 level)
- Exceptions are rare - default to formal sections
