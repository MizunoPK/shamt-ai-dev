## Issues by Dimension

### D1: Cross-Reference Accuracy ([N] issues)

#### Issue #1

**File:** path/to/file.md
**Line:** 123
**Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low

**Pattern That Found It:**
```bash
grep -rn "pattern" --include="*.md"
```markdown

**Context (5 lines):**
```text
[Line 121]
[Line 122]
→ [Line 123 - ISSUE HERE]
[Line 124]
[Line 125]
```

**Current State:**
```text
old incorrect content here
```markdown

**Should Be:**
```text
new correct content here
```

**Why This Is Wrong:**
File path points to non-existent file. After S6→S9 renumbering, this path was not updated.

**Fix Strategy:**
- [x] Automated sed replacement
- [ ] Manual edit required
- [ ] Requires user decision

**Sed Command:**
```bash
sed -i 's|old_path|new_path|g' path/to/file.md
```markdown

#### Issue #2

[Repeat template for each issue]

### D2: Terminology Consistency ([N] issues)

[Repeat for each dimension with issues]

## Confidence Assessment

### Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Used at least 5 different pattern types
- [ ] Checked all critical files (templates, CLAUDE.md, prompts)
- [ ] Searched all folders systematically
- [ ] Performed spot-checks on 10+ random files
- [ ] Tried pattern variations (punctuation, context, case)
- [ ] Manually reviewed ambiguous matches
- [ ] Documented ALL findings (even if uncertain)
- [ ] No folders skipped due to assumptions

**Confidence Score:** [0-100]%

**Factors lowering confidence:**
- [List any concerns]

**Factors raising confidence:**
- [List supporting evidence]

## Next Steps

### If Zero Issues Found

**Proceed to Stage 5 (Loop Decision) IF:**
- [x] This is Round 3 or higher
- [x] Tried at least 5 different pattern types
- [x] Spot-checked 10+ files manually
- [x] No new discoveries compared to previous round
- [x] Confidence score ≥ 80%

**Otherwise:**
- Continue to Round [N+1] with fresh patterns

### If Issues Found

**Proceed to Stage 2 (Fix Planning):**
- Group issues by pattern
- Prioritize by severity
- Create fix plan
- Execute fixes
- Verify and loop back
