## Tier 1: Re-Run Original Patterns

**Purpose:** Verify all issues from Stage 1 Discovery are resolved

### Pattern 1: [Description]

**Original Discovery Command:**
```bash
grep -rn "PATTERN" --include="*.md" path/
```

**Original Count:** [N] instances found in Stage 1

**Verification Results:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "PATTERN" --include="*.md" path/
# Results:
[Show matches OR "0 matches - ✅ Clean"]
```

**Status:** ✅ Clean / ⚠️ Remaining / ❌ Issues

**If Remaining:**
```bash
File: path/to/file.md
Line: 123
Match: [content]
Reason: [Intentional - historical example / Error - missed in Stage 3]
Action: [Document as acceptable / Fix and re-verify]
```

---

### Pattern 2: [Description]

[Repeat template for each pattern from Stage 1]

**Original Discovery Command:**
```bash
[Command]
```

**Original Count:** [N]

**Verification Results:**
```bash
[Results]
```

**Status:** ✅ Clean / ⚠️ Remaining / ❌ Issues

---

### Tier 1 Summary

**Total Patterns Re-Run:** [N]
**Patterns Clean:** [N] ✅
**Patterns with Remaining:** [N] ⚠️
**Patterns with Errors:** [N] ❌

**Tier 1 Status:** ✅ PASSED / ❌ FAILED

---

## Tier 2: New Pattern Variations

**Purpose:** Try variations of original patterns not used in Stage 1 to catch missed instances

### Why New Patterns Matter

**Original patterns might miss:**
- Punctuation variations (`:`, `-`, `.`, `,`)
- Parentheses/brackets (`(5a)`, `[5a]`)
- Context phrases ("back to 5a", "proceed to 5a")
- Case variations (lowercase, UPPERCASE)

### New Pattern 1: [Description]

**Pattern Not Tried in Stage 1:**
```bash
grep -rn "NEW_VARIATION" --include="*.md" path/
```

**Rationale:** [Why this variation might exist]

**Results:**
```bash
$ grep -rn "NEW_VARIATION" --include="*.md" path/
# Results:
[Show matches OR "0 matches - ✅ Clean"]
```

**Status:** ✅ Clean (0 matches) / ❌ Found issues (N matches)

**If Issues Found:**
```text
N_new = N_new + [count]

Examples:
- file.md:45: [content]
- file.md:67: [content]

Analysis: [Why these were missed in Stage 1]
```

---

### New Pattern 2: [Description]

[Repeat for each new pattern variation tried]

**Pattern:**
```bash
[Command]
```

**Results:**
```bash
[Results]
```

**Status:** ✅ Clean / ❌ Found issues

---

### Tier 2 Summary

**New Pattern Variations Tried:** [N] (minimum 5 required)

**Results by Pattern:**
| Pattern | Description | Matches Found | N_new Contribution |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | [Description] | 0 | 0 ✅ |
| 2 | [Description] | 3 | +3 ❌ |
| 3 | [Description] | 0 | 0 ✅ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Total N_new from Tier 2:** [N]

**Tier 2 Status:** ✅ PASSED (N_new = 0) / ❌ FAILED (N_new > 0)

---

## Tier 3: Spot-Check Random Files

**Purpose:** Manual visual inspection to catch issues grep can't find

### Random File Selection

```bash
# Command used to select random files
find stages templates reference -name "*.md" -type f | shuf -n [N]
```

**Files Selected:** [N] files (minimum 10 required)

---

### File 1: [path/to/file.md]

**Sections Checked:**
- Lines 1-50 (beginning)
- Lines [mid]-[mid+50] (middle)
- Last 50 lines (end)

**What Looked For:**
- [ ] Patterns correct in context
- [ ] No broken markdown formatting
- [ ] Headers properly leveled
- [ ] Cross-references make sense
- [ ] No obvious typos
- [ ] Terminology consistent within file
- [ ] Code blocks properly formatted
- [ ] Lists/checklists consistent

**Issues Found:** [N]

**Details:**
```markdown
[If issues found, document each:
- Line: [N]
- Issue: [Description]
- Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- N_new contribution: +1 if not caught in Stage 1
]

OR

No issues found - ✅ Clean
```

---

### File 2: [path/to/file.md]

[Repeat template for each spot-checked file]

**Sections Checked:** [Lines]

**Issues Found:** [N]

**Details:** [Details OR "No issues - ✅"]

---

### Tier 3 Summary

**Total Files Spot-Checked:** [N]
**Files Clean:** [N] ✅
**Files with Issues:** [N] ❌

**Total N_new from Tier 3:** [N]

**Tier 3 Status:** ✅ PASSED (0 issues) / ❌ FAILED (issues found)

---

## Final Counts

### The Four Critical Numbers

```markdown
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ N_found:     [XX]  (from Stage 1)           │
│ N_fixed:     [XX]  (in Stage 3)             │
│ N_remaining: [XX]  (should be 0)            │
│ N_new:       [XX]  (MUST be 0)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verification Math:**
```text
N_found = N_fixed + N_remaining
[XX] = [XX] + [XX]
✅ Math checks out / ❌ Math doesn't match
```

### N_remaining Breakdown (If > 0)

**All N_remaining instances must be documented:**

#### Remaining Instance #1
**File:** path/to/file.md
**Line:** 123
**Content:** `[old pattern still present]`
**Reason:** [Intentional - historical example / Intentional - quote / ERROR - missed fix]
**Status:** ✅ Acceptable (documented) / ❌ Must fix

[Repeat for each remaining instance]

**Summary:**
- Intentional cases: [N] (all documented and acceptable) ✅
- Errors (missed in Stage 3): [N] ❌

**If errors found:** Loop back to Stage 3, fix, re-run Stage 4

---

### N_new Breakdown (If > 0)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: N_new MUST be 0 to proceed to Stage 5**

**N_new Sources:**
- From Tier 2 (new pattern variations): [N]
- From Tier 3 (spot-checks): [N]
- **Total N_new:** [N]

**If N_new > 0:**
```markdown
❌ VERIFICATION FAILED - New issues discovered

Required Action:
1. STOP - Do not proceed to Stage 5
2. Document why these were missed in Stage 1
3. LOOP BACK to Round N+1 Stage 1
4. Use enhanced patterns in next round
5. Complete full audit loop again

Analysis of Why Missed:
[Explain what patterns/approach was insufficient in Stage 1]

Enhanced Patterns for Round N+1:
[List new patterns to use in next round's discovery]
```

- [ ] Cross-reference validation (link checking)
- [ ] File structure validation (find commands)
- [ ] Other: [Describe]

**Total Pattern Types Used:** [N]

**Status:** ✅ Sufficient diversity (≥ 5 types) / ⚠️ Limited diversity (< 5 types)

## Decision

### Exit Criteria Check (For Stage 5 Decision)

**Stage 4 Complete When ALL True:**

- [ ] All Stage 1 patterns re-run
- [ ] N_remaining = 0 OR only intentional (documented)
- [ ] Tried at least 5 new pattern variations
- [ ] N_new = 0 (no new issues discovered)
- [ ] Spot-checked 10+ random files
- [ ] Spot-checks found zero issues OR issues added to fix list
- [ ] All counts calculated (N_found, N_fixed, N_remaining, N_new)
- [ ] Verification report created
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Stage 5 (Loop Decision)

**Criteria Met:** [N]/9

### Decision Tree

```text
IF N_new > 0:
  └─> ❌ LOOP BACK to Round N+1 Stage 1
      Reason: Discovery was incomplete
      Action: Start fresh round with enhanced patterns

IF N_remaining > 0 AND not all intentional:
  └─> ❌ LOOP BACK to Stage 3
      Reason: Fixes incomplete
      Action: Apply missing fixes, re-run Stage 4

IF N_new = 0 AND N_remaining acceptable:
  └─> ✅ PROCEED to Stage 5 (Loop Decision)
      Reason: Verification passed
      Action: Evaluate exit criteria
```

**Final Decision:**
- ✅ **PROCEED to Stage 5** - Verification passed, ready for loop decision
- ❌ **LOOP to Stage 3** - Fix incomplete issues, re-verify
- ❌ **LOOP to Round N+1** - New issues found, need fresh discovery
