## What This Checks

**D18: Stage Flow Consistency** validates that adjacent stages agree on workflow behavior:

1. **Handoff Promises** - What Stage N promises to deliver matches what Stage N+1 expects
2. **Workflow Behavior** - How Stage N describes workflow matches how Stage N+1 operates
3. **Conditional Logic** - Branching in Stage N matches entry conditions in Stage N+1
4. **Terminology Alignment** - Terms introduced in Stage N used consistently in Stage N+1
5. **Scope Alignment** - Epic/feature/group scope is consistent across transitions

**Coverage:**
- All 9 stage transitions (S1->S2, S2->S3, ..., S9->S10)
- Branching transitions (S8->S5 loop, S8->S9 exit)
- Parallel work transitions (Primary->Secondary handoffs)

---

## Why This Matters

**Flow inconsistencies = Agents receive conflicting instructions at stage boundaries**

### Impact of Flow Inconsistencies:

**Handoff Mismatches:**
- Stage N promises to produce X
- Stage N+1 expects Y
- Agent confused about what inputs to use
- Example: S1 says "groups cycle through S2-S4", S2 only handles groups for S2

**Scope Confusion:**
- Stage N operates at group level
- Stage N+1 assumes epic level
- Agent unsure which scope applies
- Example: S2 says "proceed to S3 (epic-level)", S3 content says "Round 1: Group 1"

**Conditional Logic Gaps:**
- Stage N produces multiple modes (sequential, parallel, group-based)
- Stage N+1 only handles some modes
- Agent enters unhandled state
- Example: S1 produces "group-based parallel", S2 router doesn't route it

### Historical Evidence (SHAMT-8):

The group-based parallelization issue was a flow consistency problem:
- S1 promised groups would cycle through S2->S3->S4
- S2 only implemented groups for S2
- S3 had internal confusion about group vs epic scope
- **Result:** 3+ hours of confusion, 8 guide gaps identified

## How This Differs From D3

| Aspect | D3: Workflow Integration | D18: Stage Flow Consistency |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Focus** | Structural references | Behavioral continuity |
| **Checks** | File paths valid, prerequisites exist | Workflow descriptions align |
| **Scope** | Within-stage validation | Cross-stage boundary validation |
| **Example Pass** | "S2 -> S3 file path valid" | |
| **Example Fail** | | "S2 says epic-level S3, S3 says group-level" |

**D3 catches:** "S2 says Next: S4" (wrong stage number - structural)
**D18 catches:** "S2 says groups end at S2, S1 says groups continue to S4" (contradictory behavior - semantic)

**Complementary relationship:**
- Run D3 first (ensure structure is valid)
- Run D18 second (ensure behavior is consistent)

---

## Pattern Types

### Type 1: Handoff Promise Validation

**What to Check:**
What Stage N promises to deliver must match what Stage N+1 expects to receive.

**Validation Process:**

1. **Extract Stage N exit promises:**
   ```bash
   # Find what Stage N says it produces/hands off
   grep -A 15 "^## Next Stage\|^## Outputs\|^## Exit Criteria\|^## Transition" stages/sN/*.md
   ```

2. **Extract Stage N+1 entry expectations:**
   ```bash
   # Find what Stage N+1 expects to receive
   grep -A 15 "^## Prerequisites\|^## Inputs\|^## Entry\|^## Assumes" stages/s(N+1)/*.md
   ```

3. **Compare:**
   - File outputs match file inputs?
   - Workflow state descriptions match?
   - Scope/level descriptions match?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Stage N output files listed in Stage N+1 prerequisites
- [ ] Stage N workflow exit description matches Stage N+1 workflow entry
- [ ] Stage N scope (epic/feature/group) matches Stage N+1 scope assumption
- [ ] Stage N conditional branches all handled by Stage N+1

**Red Flags:**
- Stage N produces file X, Stage N+1 expects file Y
- Stage N says "workflow continues with X", Stage N+1 doesn't mention X
- Stage N operates at group scope, Stage N+1 assumes epic scope

---

### Type 2: Workflow Behavior Alignment

**What to Check:**
How Stage N describes workflow mechanics must match how Stage N+1 operates.

**Key Questions Per Transition:**

| Transition | Key Alignment Question |
|------------|------------------------|
| S1->S2 | Does S1's parallelization description match S2's handling? |
| S2->S3 | Does S2's "proceed to S3" condition match S3's prerequisites? |
| S3->S4 | Does S3's scope (epic/group) match S4's scope? |
| S4->S5 | Does S4's test strategy integrate into S5's planning? |
| S5->S6 | Does S5's plan format match S6's execution expectations? |
| S6->S7 | Does S6's completion state match S7's entry assumptions? |
| S7->S8 | Does S7's commit status match S8's alignment assumptions? |
| S8->S5 | Does S8's loop-back condition match S5's re-entry handling? |
| S8->S9 | Does S8's exit condition match S9's prerequisites? |
| S9->S10 | Does S9's QC completion match S10's entry requirements? |

**Search Commands:**
```bash
# Extract workflow descriptions from Stage N
grep -n "proceed\|after.*complete\|when.*done\|workflow" stages/sN/*.md

# Extract workflow assumptions from Stage N+1
grep -n "prerequisite\|assumes\|expect\|after" stages/s(N+1)/*.md

# Compare for consistency
```

---

### Type 3: Conditional Logic Consistency

**What to Check:**
All branching paths from Stage N must be handled by target stages.

**Critical Branching Points:**

**S1 -> S2 Branch:**
```text
S1 can produce:
- Sequential mode (user declined parallel)
- Full parallel mode (all features independent)
- Group-based parallel mode (features have dependencies)

S2 must handle:
- [ ] Sequential mode routing
- [ ] Full parallel mode routing
- [ ] Group-based parallel mode routing <- Often missed
```

**S8 -> S5 or S9 Branch:**
```text
S8 can produce:
- More features remain (loop to S5)
- All features complete (proceed to S9)

S5 must handle:
- [ ] Re-entry for next feature
- [ ] Context from previous feature

S9 must handle:
- [ ] All features committed
- [ ] Ready for epic-level QC
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Find all conditional logic in Stage N
grep -n "if\|when\|scenario\|mode\|option" stages/sN/*.md

# For each condition, verify target stage handles it
```

**Red Flags:**
- Stage N has 3 modes, Stage N+1 router only handles 2
- Stage N branching logic doesn't clearly map to Stage N+1 entries
- Conditional text in Stage N doesn't appear in Stage N+1

---

### Type 4: Terminology Alignment

**What to Check:**
Terms introduced or defined in Stage N must be used consistently in Stage N+1.

**Common Terms to Track:**

| Term | Defined In | Must Be Consistent In |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| "Dependency Group" | S1 | S2, S3 |
| "Spec-level dependency" | S1 | S2 |
| "Implementation dependency" | S1 | S5, S6 |
| "Epic-level" | S1 | All stages |
| "Feature-level" | S1 | S2, S4, S5-S8 |
| "Validation Loop" | S2 | S4, S5, S7, S9 |

**Search Commands:**
```bash
# Find term definition
grep -n "dependency group" stages/s1/*.md

# Find term usage in subsequent stages
grep -rn "dependency group" stages/s{2,3,4}/*.md

# Compare: Is meaning preserved?
```

**Red Flags:**
- Term defined one way in Stage N, used differently in Stage N+1
- Term introduced without definition, meaning unclear
- Stage N+1 redefines term with different meaning

---

### Type 5: Scope Alignment

**What to Check:**
Scope transitions (epic->feature->group->epic) must be explicit and consistent.

**Standard Scope Progression:**

| Stage | Typical Scope | Transition |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| S1 | Epic (planning whole epic) | -> S2 (feature-level) |
| S2 | Feature (within groups?) | -> S3 (epic-level) |
| S3 | Epic (cross-feature sanity) | -> S4 (feature-level) |
| S4 | Feature (test strategy) | -> S5 (feature-level) |
| S5-S8 | Feature (implementation loop) | -> S5 or S9 |
| S9 | Epic (final QC) | -> S10 (epic-level) |
| S10 | Epic (cleanup, PR) | -> Done |

**Validation:**

For each transition:
- [ ] Stage N explicitly states its scope
- [ ] Stage N+1 explicitly states its scope
- [ ] Scope transition is clear (if changing)
- [ ] No ambiguity about current scope

**Example Issue (SHAMT-8):**

**S2 Exit Scope:** "Proceed to S3 (epic-level)"
**S3 Entry Scope:** Prerequisites say "ALL features" (epic)
**S3 Content Scope:** "Round 1 S3: Group 1 features" (group)

**INCONSISTENCY:** S3 has mixed scope signals

## How Errors Happen

### Root Cause 1: Stages Authored Independently

**Scenario:**
- S1 author describes group workflow one way
- S2 author, unaware of S1's description, describes it differently
- S3 author adds group-based content without checking S1/S2

**Result:** Three stages have incompatible descriptions of same workflow

**Prevention:** D18 validation after any stage guide changes

---

### Root Cause 2: Workflow Evolution Without Cascade Updates

**Scenario:**
- Original design: Groups matter for S2, S3, S4
- Decision made: Groups only matter for S2
- S2 updated with new behavior
- S1 and S3 not updated

**Result:** S1 still describes old behavior, S3 has remnant group-based content

**Prevention:** D18 validation after workflow design changes

---

### Root Cause 3: Copy-Paste from Wrong Stage

**Scenario:**
- Creating S3 guide
- Copy-paste workflow description from S2
- S2's description doesn't apply to S3 (different scope)
- Don't notice the mismatch

**Result:** S3 content doesn't match S3's actual workflow

**Prevention:** D18 Type 2 (Workflow Behavior Alignment) validation

---

### Automation Coverage: ~30%

**Automated:**
- Finding workflow description claims
- Extracting scope language
- Detecting keyword patterns (group, parallel, sequential)
- Finding potential prerequisite-content conflicts

**Manual Required:**
- Determining if claims actually contradict
- Understanding semantic meaning of workflow descriptions
- Validating behavioral consistency
- Deciding which claim is correct

---

## Manual Validation

### Manual Process (Stage Flow Audit)

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Frequency:** After stage guide changes, workflow updates, major restructuring

**Step 1: Prepare Transition Inventory (10 min)**

```bash
# List all stage transitions to validate
transitions=(
  "S1->S2" "S2->S3" "S3->S4" "S4->S5"
  "S5->S6" "S6->S7" "S7->S8"
  "S8->S5" "S8->S9" "S9->S10"
)

# For each, extract exit and entry content
for trans in "${transitions[@]}"; do
  src="${trans%->*}"  # e.g., S1
  dst="${trans#*->}"  # e.g., S2
  echo "=== $trans ===" > /tmp/transition_$trans.txt
  echo "--- $src Exit ---" >> /tmp/transition_$trans.txt
  grep -A 10 "^## Next Stage\|^## Exit\|^## Transition" stages/$src/*.md >> /tmp/transition_$trans.txt
  echo "--- $dst Entry ---" >> /tmp/transition_$trans.txt
  grep -A 10 "^## Prerequisites\|^## Entry" stages/$dst/*.md >> /tmp/transition_$trans.txt
done
```

**Step 2: Validate Each Transition (5-10 min each)**

For each transition file:
1. Read Stage N exit description
2. Read Stage N+1 entry description
3. Check: Do they describe same workflow state?
4. Check: Is scope consistent?
5. Check: Are all conditional branches covered?
6. Document findings

**Step 3: Validate Workflow Description Consistency (15 min)**

```bash
# Extract all workflow descriptions
grep -rn "S[0-9].*->.*S[0-9]\|complete.*cycle\|group.*complete" stages/ > /tmp/workflow_claims.txt

# Group by topic
# Compare: Do all claims agree?
# Flag contradictions
```

**Step 4: Validate Scope Transitions (10 min)**

For each stage boundary:
- What scope is Stage N operating at?
- What scope does Stage N+1 expect?
- Is transition explicit or implicit?
- Any conflicting scope signals?

**Step 5: Document Findings (10 min)**

```markdown
## D18 Flow Consistency Findings

### Transitions Validated
- [ ] S1->S2: [PASS/FAIL]
- [ ] S2->S3: [PASS/FAIL]
- ...

### Issues Found
1. [Transition]: [Issue description]
2. ...

### Contradictions Detected
| File A | File B | Topic | Contradiction |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

---

## Context-Sensitive Rules

### Rule 1: Intentional Scope Transitions

**Context:** Some scope transitions are intentional and documented.

**Example:**
```markdown
S2 -> S3:
S2 operates at feature level
S3 operates at epic level
Transition is intentional: aggregate all feature specs for cross-feature sanity check
```

**Validation:** If scope change is documented and intentional -> VALID

---

### Rule 2: Parallel Work Creates Non-Linear Flow

**Context:** Parallel work coordination breaks linear S1->S2->S3 flow.

**Example:**
```markdown
Primary agent: S1 -> S2 (Feature 1) -> coordinate
Secondary agents: S2 (Features 2-N) simultaneously
All agents: -> S3 (after all complete)
```

**Validation:** Non-linear flow in parallel work is expected -> VALID

---

### Rule 3: S8 Loop Creates Multiple Entry Points

**Context:** S5 can be entered from S4 (first time) or S8 (loop).

**Example:**
```markdown
First feature: S4 -> S5
Subsequent features: S8 -> S5 (loop back)
```

**Validation:** S5 must handle both entry points -> Check both are documented

---

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Group Workflow Contradiction (SHAMT-8)

**Issue Found:**

**S1 Exit (Line 600):**
```markdown
Workflow: Each group completes full S2->S3->S4 cycle before next group starts
```

**S2 Operation (Lines 150-157):**
```markdown
After S2.P2:
- If all groups done -> Proceed to S3
```

**Analysis:**
- S1 promises: Groups cycle through S2, S3, AND S4
- S2 implements: Groups only matter for S2, then S3 is epic-level
- **FLOW INCONSISTENCY**

**Impact:**
- Agent following S1 expects group-based S3
- Agent reaching S2 finds epic-level S3
- Confusion about workflow

**Fix:**
- Update S1 to say "Groups complete S2 only, then proceed to S3 (epic-level)"
- Ensure S2 and S1 describe same workflow

**How D18 Detects:**
- Type 1: Handoff Promises (S1 promises differ from S2 behavior)
- Type 2: Workflow Behavior Alignment (descriptions don't match)

---

### Example 2: S3 Internal Scope Conflict

**Issue Found:**

**S3 Prerequisites (Line 46):**
```markdown
- ALL features have completed S2 (Feature Deep Dives)
```

**S3 Content (Lines 67-71):**
```markdown
S3 runs ONCE PER ROUND (not just once at end):
- Round 1 S3: Validate Group 1 features against each other
```

**Analysis:**
- Prerequisites say "ALL features" (epic-level)
- Content says "Round 1: Group 1" (group-level)
- **INTERNAL SCOPE CONFLICT**

**Note:** This is also caught by D10 (intra-file consistency), but D18 would flag it when validating S2->S3 transition (S2 says epic-level S3, S3 content says group-level).

**How D18 Detects:**
- Type 5: Scope Alignment (S2 exit scope doesn't match S3 content scope)

---

### Example 3: Missing S2 Router Mode

**Issue Found:**

**S1 Produces (Step 5.9):**
```markdown
Parallelization modes:
1. Sequential (user declined)
2. Full parallel (all features independent)
3. Group-based parallel (features have dependencies)
```

**S2 Router Handles:**
```markdown
### Are You a Secondary Agent? [handles #2]
### Are You Primary Agent in Parallel Mode? [handles #2]
### Are You in Sequential Mode? [handles #1]
[Missing: Group-based parallel mode]
```

**Analysis:**
- S1 can produce 3 modes
- S2 router only handles 2 modes
- Group-based parallel mode falls through

**Impact:**
- Agent with group-based epic reaches S2
- No routing guidance
- Agent confused about which guide to follow

**Fix:**
- Add "Are You Primary Agent in Group-Based Parallel Mode?" to S2 router
- Create s2_primary_agent_group_wave_guide.md

**How D18 Detects:**
- Type 3: Conditional Logic Consistency (S1 branches not all handled in S2)

---

## Integration with Other Dimensions

| Dimension | Relationship to D18 |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **D3: Workflow Integration** | D3 = structural (links valid), D18 = behavioral (content matches) |
| **D10: Intra-File Consistency** | D10 = within file, D18 = across stage boundary |
| **D9: Content Accuracy** | D9 = claims vs reality, D18 = claims vs claims across stages |
| **D16: Duplication Detection** | D16 = same content copied, D18 = contradictory content |

**Recommended Audit Order:**
1. D3 (structural validation)
2. D18 (behavioral validation)
3. D10 (within-file validation)
4. D16 (duplication/contradiction)

---

## Summary

**D18: Stage Flow Consistency validates behavioral continuity across stage transitions.**

**Key Validations:**
1. Handoff promises match expectations
2. Workflow behavior aligned across stages
3. Conditional logic fully covered
4. Terminology used consistently
5. Scope transitions explicit and consistent

**Automation: ~30%**
- Automated for finding claims and patterns
