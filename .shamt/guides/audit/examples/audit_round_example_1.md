# Audit Round Example 1: Step Number Mapping

**Epic:** SHAMT-7 (S10.P1 Guide Updates)
**Audit Context:** After completing lessons learned integration
**Round Date:** 2026-02-04
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Focus:** Step number mapping issues

---

## Round Overview

**Trigger Event:** Completed S10.P1 guide update workflow (lessons learned integration from previous epic)

**Why This Round:**
- Guide updates may introduce inconsistencies
- Step numbers may have changed during editing
- CLAUDE.md quick reference may be outdated

**Sub-Round:** Round 1.1 (Core Dimensions - D1, D2, D3, D8)

---

## Discovery Process

### Patterns Used

**Pattern 1: Step Number References in CLAUDE.md**
```bash
# Check CLAUDE.md for step number references
grep -n "Step [0-9]\|steps [0-9]" ../../../CLAUDE.md
```

**Pattern 2: Compare CLAUDE.md to Actual Guides**
```bash
# CLAUDE.md claims: "S1 Step 4.8-4.9" (parallel work offer)
# Verify in actual S1 guide:
grep -n "parallel work" ../../stages/s1/*.md
```

### Issues Found

**Total Issues:** 4 instances

| Issue # | File | Line | Problem | Severity |
|---------|------|------|---------|----------|
| 1 | CLAUDE.md | 285 | Says "S1 Step 4.8-4.9" but guide has "Step 5.8-5.9" | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 2 | CLAUDE.md | 310 | Says "S2 has 3 phases" but actual is 2 phases | 🟠 HIGH |
| 3 | README.md | 145 | Cross-reference to s1_step_4.md but file is s1_p3_discovery_phase.md | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| 4 | s2_feature_deep_dive.md | 78 | Says "see Step 3.5" but that step doesn't exist | 🟡 MEDIUM |

## Context Analysis

### Issue #1: CLAUDE.md Step Mismatch

**Pattern Found:** "S1 Step 4.8-4.9"

**Context (±5 lines):**
```markdown
**S1:** "Help me develop {epic}"
- SHAMT number, git branch, Discovery Phase (MANDATORY)
- Folder structure
- Step 4.8-4.9: Parallel work offer (if 3+ features)
```

**Analysis:**
- This is in CLAUDE.md Quick Reference section
- Claims parallel work offer happens at Step 4.8-4.9
- Checked actual s1_epic_planning.md guide
- Parallel work offer actually at Step 5.8-5.9
- This is NOT a historical reference (no marker)
- This is current workflow documentation

**Decision:** ERROR (not intentional)

**Root Cause:** CLAUDE.md wasn't updated when S1 guide restructured steps

---

### Issue #2: Phase Count Mismatch

**Pattern Found:** "S2 has 3 phases"

**Context (±5 lines):**
```markdown
## S2: Feature Deep Dive

Detailed specification for each feature across 3 phases:
- P1: Specification Creation
- P2: Cross-Feature Alignment
- P3: User Approval
```

**Analysis:**
- CLAUDE.md lists 3 phases for S2
- Checked stages/s2/ directory
- Only 2 phase guides exist: s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md, s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md
- No s2_p3_* file
- User approval is embedded in P2, not separate phase

**Decision:** ERROR (outdated count)

**Root Cause:** S2 was simplified from 3 to 2 phases, CLAUDE.md not updated

---

### Issue #3: Broken Cross-Reference

**Pattern Found:** "s1_step_4.md"

**Context (±5 lines):**
```markdown
For detailed discovery workflow, see:
- `stages/s1/s1_step_4.md` - Discovery phase protocol
```

**Analysis:**
- README.md references file "s1_step_4.md"
- Checked stages/s1/ directory
- No file with that name exists
- Found: s1_p3_discovery_phase.md (Discovery Phase)
- This is the same content, file was renamed

**Decision:** ERROR (broken reference)

**Root Cause:** File renamed during S1 restructuring, README.md not updated

---

### Issue #4: Non-Existent Step Reference

**Pattern Found:** "see Step 3.5"

**Context (±5 lines):**
```markdown
## Iteration 2: Research Execution

Execute research plan from previous iteration. For validation criteria, see Step 3.5.
```

**Analysis:**
- s2_feature_deep_dive.md references "Step 3.5"
- Checked file structure - no step numbers, uses iteration notation
- File has: I1, I2, I3 (iterations), no "Step 3.5"
- Likely copy-paste from old guide structure

**Decision:** ERROR (non-existent reference)

**Root Cause:** Old step-based reference not updated to iteration notation

---

## Fix Planning

### Group 1: CLAUDE.md Step Numbers (2 issues)

**Fixes:**
- Issue #1: Change "Step 4.8-4.9" → "Step 5.8-5.9"
- Issue #2: Change "3 phases" → "2 phases", remove P3 from list

**Verification:**
```bash
# After fixes, verify CLAUDE.md matches actual guides
# Check S1 parallel work step number
grep -n "parallel work" ../../../CLAUDE.md
grep -n "parallel work" ../../stages/s1/s1_epic_planning.md
# Line numbers should match

# Check S2 phase count
grep -n "S2.*phases\|Stage 2.*phases" ../../../CLAUDE.md
ls -1 ../../stages/s2/s2_p*.md | wc -l  # Should be 2
```

---

### Group 2: Broken References (2 issues)

**Fixes:**
- Issue #3: Change "s1_step_4.md" → "s1_p3_discovery_phase.md"
- Issue #4: Update "see Step 3.5" → "see Iteration 2" OR remove reference if not needed

**Verification:**
```bash
# Verify all referenced files exist
grep -rh "stages/s[0-9].*\.md" README.md | \
  grep -o "stages/[^)]*\.md" | \
  while read path; do
    [ ! -f "../$path" ] && echo "BROKEN: $path"
  done
```

## Verification Results

### Re-Run Discovery Patterns

**Pattern 1: CLAUDE.md Step Numbers**
```bash
$ grep -n "Step [45]\.[0-9]" ../../../CLAUDE.md
285: - Step 5.8-5.9: Parallel work offer (if 3+ features)
# ✅ Now shows 5.8-5.9 (correct)
```

**Pattern 2: S2 Phase Count**
```bash
$ grep -n "S2.*phases\|Stage 2.*phases" ../../../CLAUDE.md
310: Detailed specification for each feature across 2 phases:
# ✅ Now shows 2 phases (correct)
```

**Pattern 3: Broken File References**
```bash
$ grep -rh "s1_step_4\.md" README.md
[no output]
# ✅ Zero instances (fixed)

$ grep -rh "s1_p3_discovery_phase\.md" README.md
- `stages/s1/s1_p3_discovery_phase.md` - Discovery phase protocol
# ✅ New reference present
```

**Pattern 4: Non-Existent Steps**
```bash
$ grep -rn "Step 3\.5" ../../stages/s2/*.md
[no output]
# ✅ Zero instances (fixed)
```

### Counts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| N_found (Stage 1) | 4 |
| N_fixed (Stage 3) | 4 |
| N_remaining (Stage 4) | 0 |
| N_new (Stage 4) | 0 |

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

✅ **Targeted search** - Focused on step numbers and references after guide updates
✅ **Root file check** - CLAUDE.md and README.md yielded all 4 issues
✅ **Cross-validation** - Compared claims in summary files to actual guides

### What Was Missed (Found in Later Rounds)

❌ **Pattern variations** - Only searched "Step X.X", missed "steps X-X" format
❌ **Other root files** - Didn't check EPIC_WORKFLOW_USAGE.md in this round
❌ **Notation issues** - Focused on step numbers, missed old notation (found in Round 3)

### For Next Round

**Expand patterns:**
- Search "steps X-X" format (plural, range)
- Search "Stage X, Step Y" format (comma-separated)
- Check EPIC_WORKFLOW_USAGE.md specifically

**Expand scope:**
- Check templates/ for step number references
- Check prompts_reference_v2.md for step mentions

---

## Round Summary

**Issues Found:** 4
**Issues Fixed:** 4
**Files Modified:** 3 (CLAUDE.md, README.md, s2_feature_deep_dive.md)
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Next Action:** Round 2 (expand to router links and path formats)

**Key Takeaway:** Root files (CLAUDE.md, README.md) had all issues in this category. Always check root files first for cross-reference issues.
