## Audit Process Overview (Sub-Round System)

**The audit uses a 4 sub-round structure per round, organized by dimension category:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         AUDIT LOOP (Repeat until ZERO new issues found)         │
│   3 CONSECUTIVE ZERO-ISSUE ROUNDS (12+ sub-rounds min each)     │
│  EXIT TRIGGER: Round N all 4 sub-rounds ZERO issues + 9 criteria│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Round N:
  │
  ├─> Sub-Round N.1: Core Dimensions (D1, D2, D3, D4)
  │   S1: Discovery → S2: Planning → S3: Apply → S4: Verify → S5: Loop Decision
  │   If 0 issues → Sub-Round N.2 | If issues → Fix & Re-run N.1
  │
  ├─> Sub-Round N.2: Content Quality (D5, D6, D7, D8, D9)
  │   S1: Discovery → S2: Planning → S3: Apply → S4: Verify → S5: Loop Decision
  │   If 0 issues → Sub-Round N.3 | If issues → Fix & Re-run N.2
  │
  ├─> Sub-Round N.3: Structural (D10, D11, D12, D13, D14)
  │   S1: Discovery → S2: Planning → S3: Apply → S4: Verify → S5: Loop Decision
  │   If 0 issues → Sub-Round N.4 | If issues → Fix & Re-run N.3
  │
  └─> Sub-Round N.4: Advanced (D15, D16, D17, D18, D19, D20)
      S1: Discovery → S2: Planning → S3: Apply → S4: Verify → S5: Loop Decision
      If 0 issues → Round N complete | If issues → Fix & Re-run N.4

Round N complete → Round N+1 (fresh eyes) → EXIT when all criteria met
```

### Sub-Round Benefits

1. **Dependency Management:** Core fixes (broken references) applied before Structural checks
2. **Focused Discovery:** Check 4-5 related dimensions per sub-round, not all 20 at once
3. **Incremental Verification:** Verify fixes before moving to next category
4. **Mental Clarity:** Fresh mental model between dimension categories
5. **Complete Coverage:** ALL 20 dimensions checked systematically every round
6. **No Blind Spots:** Can't skip dimensions accidentally

---

## Navigation by Stage

| Stage | Guide | Duration | Primary Activities | Output |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **1. Discovery** | `stages/stage_1_discovery.md` | 30-60 min | Find issues using search patterns | Discovery report |
| **2. Fix Planning** | `stages/stage_2_fix_planning.md` | 30-90 min | Group issues, **investigate complex issues**, ask user if uncertain | Fix plan + user questions |
| **3. Apply Fixes** | `stages/stage_3_apply_fixes.md` | 60-180 min | Apply ALL fixes (content + file size), **no deferrals** | Fixed files |
| **4. Verification** | `stages/stage_4_verification.md` | 30-45 min | Re-run patterns, spot-check, verify ALL fixes | Verification report |
| **5. Loop Decision** | `stages/stage_5_loop_decision.md` | 15-30 min | Report results, decide continue/exit | Round summary |

**Critical Rules:**
- Complete stages sequentially. Never skip stages.
- **NO DEFERRALS ALLOWED** - Investigate or ask user, never defer to later rounds
- File size reduction is first-class work (not deferred). See `reference/file_size_reduction_guide.md`
- Duration estimates include investigation time - deep dives are EXPECTED

---

## Sub-Round Structure

**Each round consists of 4 sub-rounds organized by dimension category:**

| Sub-Round | Dimensions | Count | Focus | Duration |
|-----------|------------|-------|-------|----------|
| **N.1: Core** | D1, D2, D3, D4 | 4 | File paths, terminology, workflow, CLAUDE.md | 60-90 min |
| **N.2: Content** | D5, D6, D7, D8, D9 | 5 | Counts, completeness, templates, documentation | 75-120 min |
| **N.3: Structural** | D10, D11, D12, D13, D14 | 5 | File consistency, size, patterns, dependencies, character compliance | 60-90 min |
| **N.4: Advanced** | D15, D16, D17, D18, D19, D20 | 6 | Context-sensitive, duplication, accessibility, flow, rules alignment, script integrity | 60-90 min |
| **TOTAL** | All 20 dimensions | 20 | Complete coverage | 4.5-6.5 hours |

**Execution Order:**
1. **Core first** - Fixes broken references and inconsistent notation that affect all other checks
2. **Content second** - Content fixes may reveal structural issues
3. **Structural third** - Structure depends on correct content and references
4. **Advanced last** - Advanced checks require all other dimensions to be clean

**Loop Logic:**
- Sub-round finds issues → Fix ALL → Re-run SAME sub-round → Repeat until 0 issues
- Sub-round clean → Proceed to next sub-round
- All 4 sub-rounds clean → Round complete → Next round (fresh eyes)
- 3 CONSECUTIVE zero-issue rounds required to exit (rounds with issues reset the counter to 0)

## Navigation by Audit Dimension

The audit evaluates guides across **20 critical dimensions**:

### Core Dimensions (Always Check)

| Dimension | Guide | Focus | Automation |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|
| **D1: Cross-Reference Accuracy** | `dimensions/d1_cross_reference_accuracy.md` | File paths, links | 90% automated |

**Usage:** Read dimension guides as needed during discovery. Not all dimensions apply to every audit.

---

## Recommended Dimension Reading Order

**Avoid circular dependencies - start with foundational dimensions, then build up.**

### Level 1: Foundational (Start Here)
Read these first - they're most common and easiest to validate:
- **D1: Cross-Reference Accuracy** - File paths, links (90% automated)
- **D2: Terminology Consistency** - Notation, naming (80% automated)

**Why start here:** Most audit issues fall into D1-D2. High automation = quick wins.

### Level 2: Content Quality (After Level 1)
Build on D1-D2 findings:
- **D6: Content Completeness** - Finds missing sections that D1 cross-references pointed to
- **D8: Documentation Quality** - Expands D6 with structure requirements

### Level 3: Structural (Optional, As Needed)
Deep-dive validations for specific issues:
- **D10: Intra-File Consistency** - Within-file quality (use if files seem inconsistent)
- **D11: File Size Assessment** - Readability limits (use if files seem too large)
- **D12: Structural Patterns** - Template compliance (use after template changes)

### Level 4: Advanced (Rare, Specialized)
Only needed for specific scenarios:
- **D15: Context-Sensitive Validation** - Distinguishing errors from intentional cases
- **D16: Duplication Detection** - Finding duplicate content across guides

**Note:** You don't need to read ALL dimension guides for every audit. Read what's relevant to your trigger event (see Common Scenarios below).

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: After S10.P1 Guide Updates

**Trigger:** Just completed lessons learned integration (S10.P1)

**High-Risk Dimensions:**
1. D1: Cross-Reference Accuracy (guide changes may break links)
2. D2: Terminology Consistency (new terminology may be inconsistent)
3. D7: Template Currency (templates may not reflect guide changes)
4. D4: CLAUDE.md Sync (quick reference may be outdated)

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
# Run pre-checks
bash scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh

# Start Round 1 focusing on high-risk dimensions
# Read stages/stage_1_discovery.md
# Then read d1, d2, d6, d8 dimension guides
```markdown

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 hours (5-8 rounds typical)

---

### Scenario 2: After Stage Renumbering

**Trigger:** Major restructuring (e.g., S5 split into S5-S8, S6→S9, S7→S10)

**High-Risk Dimensions:**
1. D1: Cross-Reference Accuracy (old stage numbers in references)
2. D3: Workflow Integration (prerequisite chains broken)
3. D7: Template Currency (templates have old stage numbers)
4. D4: CLAUDE.md Sync (quick reference outdated)
5. D13: Cross-File Dependencies (stage transitions broken)

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
# Run pre-checks
bash scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh

# Start Round 1 with comprehensive search
# Focus on old stage number patterns
# Read all 5 high-risk dimension guides
```

**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours (5-8 rounds typical)

---

### Scenario 3: After Terminology Changes

**Trigger:** Notation updates (e.g., "Stage 5a" → "S5.P1")

**High-Risk Dimensions:**
1. D2: Terminology Consistency (old notation stragglers)
2. D7: Template Currency (templates use old notation)
3. D15: Context-Sensitive Validation (intentional old notation in examples)
4. D10: Intra-File Consistency (mixed notation within files)

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
# Run pre-checks
bash scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh

# Generate pattern variations of old notation
# Read dimensions/d2_terminology_consistency.md for pattern strategies
# Manual review for context-sensitive cases
```markdown

**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 hours (5-8 rounds typical)

---

### Scenario 4: User Reports Inconsistency

**Trigger:** User found error or reports confusion

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Spot-Audit:** Check the specific file and related files
2. **Assess Scope:** Is this isolated or widespread?
3. **If Isolated:** Fix and verify immediately
4. **If Widespread:** Run full audit focusing on related dimension

```bash
# Example: User reports broken link in S5 guide
# Step 1: Fix the specific issue
# Step 2: Run cross-reference validation on all S5 files
grep -rn "stages/s5" stages/s5/*.md | grep "\.md"

# Step 3: If many broken links, run full D1 audit
# Read dimensions/d1_cross_reference_accuracy.md
```

---

### Scenario 5: Quarterly Maintenance

**Trigger:** Routine quality check (no specific changes)

**Recommended Approach:**
```bash
# Run automated checks
bash scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh

# If clean: No manual audit needed
# If issues found: Run focused audit on failing dimensions
```diff

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours (mostly automated)

---

## Automated Scripts

### Pre-Audit Checks
`scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh` - Run before manual audit begins
- Checks 12 of 20 dimensions (D1, D3, D4, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12, D14, D17, D18, D20 partial)
- Catches common structural issues (estimated 45-55% of typical issues)
- Fast execution (5 minutes)
- Generates initial report
- **NOT checked:** D2 Terminology (most common - requires manual pattern search)

### Individual Check Scripts
**Design Decision:** Checks are intentionally **consolidated** into `pre_audit_checks.sh` rather than separate scripts.

**Rationale:**
- Single command runs all automated checks
- Unified output format and error handling
- Easier maintenance (one file vs 7)
- Better performance (~5 minutes total)
- Most audits run all checks anyway (not selective)

**What would have been separate scripts:**
- `check_file_sizes.sh` - D11: File size and complexity assessment
- `validate_structure.sh` - D12: Structural pattern validation
- `check_completeness.sh` - D8: Documentation quality checks
- `verify_counts.sh` - D9: Content accuracy validation
- `check_navigation.sh` - D17: Accessibility checks
- `find_duplicates.sh` - D16: Duplication detection
- `validate_dependencies.sh` - D13: Cross-file dependency checks

**All functionality available in:** `scripts/pre_audit_checks.sh` (covers 12 dimensions — see "Pre-Audit Checks" section above)

---

## Outputs

**Output files are temporary working documents — never commit them.**

`audit/outputs/` is listed in the project `.gitignore` so output files are automatically excluded from git tracking.

**Note on historical output files:** Output reports in `audit/outputs/` from before February 2026 (pre-SHAMT-2) use the old dimension numbering scheme (D1-D18 with a different grouping). These are historical records and retain their original numbers — do not update them.

### Per-Round Working Files (`audit/outputs/`)

| File | Created When | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `round_N_discovery_report.md` | Stage 1 | Issues found during discovery |
| `round_N_fix_plan.md` | Stage 2 | Grouped fixes with priorities |
| `round_N_verification_report.md` | Stage 4 | Before/after evidence |
| `round_N_loop_decision.md` | Stage 5 | Round summary and exit decision |
| `round_N_improvements_working.md` | Start of round | Improvement candidates for audit guides |

### Improvements Working File

`round_N_improvements_working.md` captures improvement opportunities for the audit guides
themselves — not epic workflow guides (those go through S10 lessons learned).

- **Created:** At start of each round using `templates/improvements_working_template.md`
- **Updated:** Add entries throughout the round as improvements are noticed
- **Reviewed:** At round completion in Stage 5 "End-of-Round: Improvements Review"
- **Cleared:** Not carried forward — a fresh file is created for each round
- **Never committed:** All `outputs/` files stay local

**See:** `stages/stage_5_loop_decision.md` → "End-of-Round: Improvements Review" for the full workflow.

## Critical Success Factors

### Minimum Requirements for Audit Completion

**ALL 9 exit criteria must be met:**
1. ✅ All issues resolved | 2. ✅ Zero new discoveries | 3. ✅ Zero verification findings
4. ✅ 3 consecutive zero-issue rounds | 5. ✅ All documented | 6. ✅ User approved
7. ✅ Confidence ≥80% | 8. ✅ Pattern diversity | 9. ✅ Spot-checks clean

**See `stages/stage_5_loop_decision.md` for detailed criteria with sub-requirements.**

**IF USER CHALLENGES YOU:**
- Immediately loop back to Round 1
- User challenge = evidence you missed something
- Do NOT defend - user is usually right
- Re-verify EVERYTHING with fresh patterns

---

## Philosophy

**🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DEFERRALS - CRITICAL POLICY**

**ALL identified issues MUST be investigated and addressed immediately.**

- **NO deferring to "later rounds" or "post-audit"**
- **Deep dives into files are ENCOURAGED** - Read files, analyze context, determine fixes
- **If uncertain after investigation, ASK THE USER** - Don't defer, get clarity
- **Audit purpose:** Achieve OPTIMAL state, not just quick wins

**Decision Framework:**
```text
Issue discovered → Can I fix with confidence?
  ├─ YES → Fix immediately
  └─ NO  → Read files, investigate (15-30 min)
            ├─ NOW confident? → Fix immediately
            └─ Still uncertain? → ASK USER (provide analysis + options)
```

**Fresh Eyes, Zero Assumptions, User Skepticism is Healthy**

- Approach each round as if you've never seen the codebase
- Question everything, verify everything, assume you missed something
- Use iterative loops until 3 consecutive zero-issue rounds achieved (typically 5-8 total rounds)
- Provide evidence, not just claims
- When user challenges you, THEY ARE USUALLY RIGHT - re-verify immediately

**Historical Evidence:**
- Session 2-3 audits: 221+ fixes across 110 files
- Premature completion claims: 3 times (each time, 50+ more issues found)
- User challenges: 3 ("are you sure?", "did you actually make fixes?", "assume everything is wrong")
- Rounds required: 3+ to reach zero new issues
- **Historical deferral failure:** Round 1-2 deferred 137 issues (67% deferral rate) - ALL should have been investigated and addressed
