## Overview

### Purpose

**Stage 5: Loop Decision** is where you determine if the audit is complete or if another round is needed.

**Two outcomes possible:**
1. **EXIT** - Audit complete, all criteria met, current round found ZERO issues
2. **LOOP** - Continue to Round N+1 with fresh patterns

**Critical Principle:** Better to do one more round than exit prematurely.

### MANDATORY Loop Conditions (Sub-Round System)

```

**If current sub-round (N.X) found issues:**
- You MUST fix ALL issues from sub-round N.X
- You MUST re-run SAME sub-round N.X
- You CANNOT proceed to next sub-round until current clean

**If current sub-round (N.X) found ZERO issues:**
- Sub-Round N.1 clean → Proceed to N.2
- Sub-Round N.2 clean → Proceed to N.3
- Sub-Round N.3 clean → Proceed to N.4
- Sub-Round N.4 clean → Round N complete

**If Round N complete (all 4 sub-rounds clean):**
- Proceed to Round N+1, Sub-Round (N+1).1
- Use fresh patterns, different approach
- Reset mental model between rounds

**"3 consecutive clean rounds" = at minimum 12 sub-rounds total:**
- A round is clean if it has ≤1 LOW-severity issue (fixed); 2+ LOW or any MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL resets counter
- Each clean round = 4 sub-rounds, so 3 clean rounds = 12 minimum cycles
- Exit trigger: 3 CONSECUTIVE clean rounds + all 9 criteria met
- Rounds with multiple LOW or any MEDIUM+ severity issues reset the counter; you may need 5-8+ total rounds
- See `reference/severity_classification_universal.md` for severity definitions

### Why This Stage Matters

**Historical Evidence (SHAMT-7 Audit):**
- Agents naturally want to finish quickly
- Premature exit = missed issues
- "Are you sure?" from user = red flag
- 3 consecutive clean rounds is NOT arbitrary - it's evidence-based
- SHAMT-7 needed **4 rounds** before achieving first clean round

**From monolithic guide:**
> "Premature completion claims: 3 times (each time, 50+ more issues found)"

## Prerequisites

### Before Making Loop Decision

**Verify you have:**

- [ ] Completed Stage 4 (Verification)
- [ ] Verification report with all counts
- [ ] N_new = 0 (no new issues in verification)
- [ ] N_remaining documented (intentional cases explained)
- [ ] Spot-check results (10+ files)
- [ ] Pattern variation results (5+ patterns)
- [ ] Round summary prepared

**If missing any:** Return to Stage 4 and complete verification fully.

---

## Exit Criteria Checklist

### ALL Must Be True to Exit

**Check each criterion - failing ANY means LOOP:**

#### Criterion 1: All Issues Resolved
- [ ] ALL issues from ALL rounds have been fixed
- [ ] Zero issues remaining from Round 1
- [ ] Zero issues remaining from Round 2
- [ ] Zero issues remaining from Round N-1
- [ ] Zero issues remaining from Round N

**If ANY issues remain unfixed:** MUST loop (not optional)

#### Criterion 2: Zero New Discoveries (All Sub-Rounds)
- [ ] Sub-Round N.1 (Core) Discovery found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.2 (Content) Discovery found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.3 (Structural) Discovery found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.4 (Advanced) Discovery found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Tried at least 5 different pattern types per dimension category
- [ ] Searched all folders systematically in each sub-round
- [ ] Used automated scripts + manual search per sub-round

**If ANY sub-round found new issues in Stage 1:** MUST loop same sub-round (mandatory)

#### Criterion 3: Zero Verification Findings (All Sub-Rounds)
- [ ] Sub-Round N.1 (Core) Verification found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.2 (Content) Verification found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.3 (Structural) Verification found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Sub-Round N.4 (Advanced) Verification found ZERO new issues
- [ ] Re-ran all patterns from Discovery per sub-round
- [ ] Tried pattern variations not used in Discovery per sub-round
- [ ] Spot-checked 10+ random files per sub-round

**If ANY N_new > 0 in any sub-round:** MUST loop same sub-round (mandatory)

#### Criterion 4: 3 Consecutive Clean Rounds
- [ ] Completed at least 3 CONSECUTIVE clean rounds (≤1 LOW per round)
  - Track explicitly: `consecutive_clean = [current count]`
  - Rounds with 2+ LOW or any MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL reset counter to 0
  - [ ] Clean round (0 issues OR 1 LOW fixed) — consecutive_clean = 1
  - [ ] Clean round (0 issues OR 1 LOW fixed) — consecutive_clean = 2
  - [ ] Clean round (0 issues OR 1 LOW fixed) — consecutive_clean = 3 ✓
- [ ] Each round used different patterns than previous
- [ ] Each sub-round focused on correct dimension set
- [ ] Clear mental break between rounds (fresh perspective)
- [ ] All 22 dimensions checked at least 3 times (once per clean round)

**If consecutive_clean < 3:** MUST loop (regardless of total rounds completed)
**If ANY sub-round skipped:** MUST loop (all 4 sub-rounds mandatory)
**If 2+ LOW or any MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL found:** Reset consecutive_clean to 0 and loop

**Critical distinction:** "Minimum 3 rounds" means 3 CONSECUTIVE clean rounds.
A round with 2+ LOW or any higher severity does not count. Rounds 1(issues), 2(issues), 3(clean) = consecutive_clean of 1, not 3.

#### Criterion 5: All Remaining Documented
- [ ] All remaining pattern matches are documented
- [ ] Each has: File path + line number
- [ ] Each has: Why it's intentional
- [ ] Each has: Why it's acceptable
- [ ] Context analysis performed for each

**If undocumented matches remain:** MUST loop

#### Criterion 6: User Verification Passed
- [ ] User has NOT challenged findings
- [ ] No "are you sure?" questions from user
- [ ] No "did you actually make fixes?" questions
- [ ] No "assume everything is wrong" requests

**If user challenged:** IMMEDIATELY loop back to Round 1

#### Criterion 7: Confidence Calibrated
- [ ] Confidence score ≥ 80% (see `reference/confidence_calibration.md`)
- [ ] Self-assessed using scoring rubric
- [ ] No red flags present
- [ ] Feel genuinely complete, not just wanting to finish

**If confidence < 80%:** MUST loop

#### Criterion 8: Pattern Diversity
- [ ] Used at least 5 different pattern types across ALL rounds
- [ ] Basic exact matches ✓
- [ ] Pattern variations ✓
- [ ] Contextual patterns ✓
- [ ] Manual reading ✓
- [ ] Spot-checks ✓

**If pattern diversity < 5 types:** MUST loop

#### Criterion 9: Spot-Check Clean
- [ ] Random sample of 10+ files shows zero issues
- [ ] Files selected randomly (not cherry-picked)
- [ ] Manually read sections (not just grep)
- [ ] No issues found in visual inspection

**If spot-checks found issues:** MUST loop

## End-of-Round: Improvements Review

### When This Runs

**Trigger:** All 4 sub-rounds of Round N found ZERO issues (round complete)

**Runs:** BEFORE deciding to exit OR loop to next round — at every round completion.

---

### Purpose

As the audit processes guides, the agent naturally notices opportunities to improve the audit guides
themselves. This step captures those observations, proposes changes formally, and gets user approval
before implementing.

**Scope — Audit Guides ONLY:**
- ✅ Files in `audit/` (`stages/`, `dimensions/`, `reference/`, `templates/`, `README.md`, `audit_overview.md`)
- ❌ Epic workflow guides (`stages/s1/` through `stages/s10/`, etc.) — those improvements go through S10 lessons learned

---

### Step 1: Review Working File

Open `audit/outputs/round_N_improvements_working.md`.

- **If empty or does not exist:** No improvements this round — skip to next section
- **If has entries:** Proceed to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Write Formal Proposals

For each improvement candidate in the working file, write a formal proposal
(use `../templates/improvements_working_template.md` → "Formal Proposals" section as your format):

```markdown
## Improvement Proposal N: [Short Name]

**Category:** [Dimension Guidance | Process Clarity | New Rule | New Example | Readability | Other]
**Priority:** [High | Medium | Low]
**Affected Files:** [List of audit files to change]

**Problem:**
[What is currently unclear, wrong, missing, or misleading?]

**Proposed Change:**
[Exactly what to add / change / remove — specific enough to implement directly]

**Why This Matters:**
[Impact on audit quality, agent effectiveness, or guide accuracy]

**Example (if applicable):**
[Before / After or concrete example]
```

---

### Step 3: Present to User

Present ALL proposals in a single message:

```markdown
## End-of-Round N: Improvements Review

Identified [N] improvement candidates for the audit guides this round.

[Paste all formal proposals here]

**For each proposal, please indicate:** Approve / Reject / Modify
```

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

### Step 4: Implement Approved Changes

For each approved proposal:
1. Apply the specific change to the affected audit file(s)
2. Mark the entry in the working file as: `IMPLEMENTED`

For rejected proposals: mark as `REJECTED` (note user's reasoning if provided).

---

### Step 5: Meta-Audit Changed Files

Run a focused mini-validation on only the audit files that were changed:

**Checks to run per changed file:**
- [ ] D1: No broken cross-references introduced
- [ ] D2: Consistent terminology (no notation drift)
- [ ] D10: Internal consistency within changed sections
- [ ] D16: No duplication introduced

**Process:**
```text
For each changed audit file:
  1. Read the changed sections
  2. Check D1 / D2 / D10 / D16
  3. Issues found → fix immediately → re-check same file
  4. Clean → proceed to next file

All changed files clean → Meta-audit complete
```

**This is a focused check, NOT a full 3-round audit.** Exit when all changed files pass.

---

### Step 6: Clear Working File

The working file is temporary — **do NOT commit it.**

- **Continuing to Round N+1:** File is no longer needed. Create a fresh
  `round_(N+1)_improvements_working.md` at the start of Round N+1.
- **Exiting audit:** Leave the working file uncommitted (expected — `outputs/` files are never committed).

---

**After improvements review complete:**
→ Proceed to [If Continuing to Next Round](#if-continuing-to-next-round) or [If Exiting Audit](#if-exiting-audit)

---

## If Continuing to Next Round

### When to Loop

**MUST loop if:**
- ANY of the 9 criteria failed
- User challenged findings
- You feel uncertain about completeness
- Spot-checks revealed issues

### Preparing for Next Round

**Before starting Round N+1:**

```markdown
## Round N+1 Preparation

### Why Looping
[List which criteria failed]

### Lessons from Round N
[What was missed, why it was missed]

### Changes for Round N+1
**Different Patterns:**
- [List new patterns to try]

**Different Approach:**
- [Different folder order, different search strategy]

**Fresh Eyes:**
- [Take 5-10 minute break]
- [Clear assumptions from Round N]
- [Approach as if first time]

### Specific Focus
[What to pay extra attention to]
```

### Starting Round N+1

```text
1. Take 5-10 minute break (clear mental model)
   ↓
2. Create fresh `round_(N+1)_improvements_working.md` in `audit/outputs/`
   (use `../templates/improvements_working_template.md`)
   ↓
3. Do NOT look at Round N notes until after discovery
   ↓
4. Return to Stage 1: Discovery
   ↓
5. Use completely different patterns than Round N
   ↓
6. Search folders in different order
   ↓
7. Complete all 5 stages again
   ↓
8. Return to Stage 5 decision
```

## If Exiting Audit

### When Exit is Appropriate

**Only exit if:**
- ALL 9 criteria met
- User approves exit
- Feel genuinely complete (not just tired)
- No lingering doubts

### Final Actions Before Exit

```markdown
# Audit Results - Round N Complete

## Executive Summary

**Status:** Ready to exit OR Need another round
**Total Issues:** [N found, N fixed, N remaining]
**Confidence:** [XX%]
**Recommendation:** [EXIT or LOOP]

## Evidence

### Verification Passed
- N_new = 0
- N_remaining = 0 (or only intentional)
- Spot-checks clean (10+ files)
- 5+ pattern types used

### All Criteria Met
- [x] Criterion 1: All issues resolved

### Before/After Examples
[Show 2-3 examples of fixes with context]

## Invite Challenge

Please review findings and challenge if:
- You see incomplete verification
- You notice patterns we missed
- You have doubts about completeness
- You see issues we didn't catch

**If you say "are you sure?", I will immediately loop back to Round 1**
```

### Responding to User

**If user approves:**
```text
✅ Proceed to commit
```diff

**If user challenges:**
```bash
🚨 IMMEDIATELY loop back to Round 1
- User challenge = evidence of missed issues
- Do NOT defend findings
- Assume user is correct
- Start fresh with new patterns
```

**If user asks clarifying questions:**
```text
Answer thoroughly, then:
- If still satisfied → commit
- If user expresses doubt → loop back
```

## Commit Strategy

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Never Commit Output Files

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️ OUTPUT FILES MUST NOT BE COMMITTED                          │
│                                                                  │

│  Output files are temporary working documents, not source        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Commit

**Only commit if:**
- All 9 exit criteria met
- User approved exit
- Round summary created
- No outstanding issues

### Commit Organization

**Strategy:** One commit per round (guide fixes ONLY)

**🚨 MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECK:**

Before staging any commit, verify guides are not gitignored:

```bash
# Check if .shamt/guides/ is gitignored
git check-ignore .shamt/guides/ 2>/dev/null
```

- If ANY output (files are ignored) → **STOP. Do NOT commit audit fixes.**
  - Apply fixes locally (files are updated on disk)
  - Inform user: "Audit fixes applied locally but not committed — guide files are gitignored in this project."
  - Skip all commit steps
- If NO output (files are not ignored) → proceed with commits below

**NEVER use `git add -f` or `git add --force` to bypass gitignore for guide files.**

**Per-Round Commit (if guides are NOT gitignored):**

```bash
# For each round, commit ONLY the guide fixes (exclude output files)
git add stages/ reference/ templates/ debugging/ missed_requirement/ prompts/ *.md
git commit -m "feat/SHAMT-7: Apply Round N audit fixes - [focus]"

# Example for Round 3:
git add stages/ reference/ templates/ EPIC_WORKFLOW_USAGE.md
git commit -m "feat/SHAMT-7: Apply Round 3 audit fixes - notation standardization

Fixed 70+ instances of old notation across 30+ files:

Group 1: Old Stage Notation (60+ instances)
- S5a → S5, S6a → S6, S7a → S7, S8a → S8, S9a → S9

Group 2: STAGE_Xx Format (1 instance)
- s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md: STAGE_5a → S5

Group 3: Wrong Stage Header (1 instance)
- s10_epic_cleanup.md: CRITICAL RULES FOR STAGE 7 → STAGE 10

Verification: Zero remaining issues
"
```

**DO NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`:**
- These will commit output files (incorrect)
- Explicitly list directories/files to commit

**DO NOT use `git add -f` or `git add --force`:**
- Never force-add gitignored files
- If guides are gitignored, apply fixes locally but skip commits

### Final Commit

**After all rounds complete:**

```bash
# All round commits done individually (guide fixes only)
# Output files remain uncommitted

git log --oneline | head -10
# Shows all round commits

# Verify no output files were committed
git diff --name-only main | grep "audit/outputs"
# Should return nothing (no output files in commit)
```
