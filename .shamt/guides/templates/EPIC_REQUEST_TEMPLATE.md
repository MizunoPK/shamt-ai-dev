# Epic Request Template

**File Location:** `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic-name}.md`

**Purpose:** This file captures the epic request BEFORE S1 starts. It should contain high-level requirements, goals, constraints, and initial research. Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW to implement it.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**
- This file stays in `.shamt/epics/requests/` until the user explicitly initiates S1
- **DO NOT** create a `SHAMT-{N}/` folder when writing an epic request
- **DO NOT** include code snippets, detailed schemas, or implementation details
- **DO** mention files/modules that MAY need updating (not specific code changes)
- **DO** reference general practices to follow (e.g., "follow existing agent pattern")
- The S1-S10 epic flow will determine detailed design and implementation

## Next Steps

**To proceed with this epic:**
1. User reviews this request
2. User says "Start S1 for [epic name]"
3. Agent reads `.shamt/guides/stages/s1/s1_epic_planning.md`
4. Agent creates git branch and SHAMT-{N} folder during S1
5. Agent runs S1 Discovery Phase to refine this request

**This request file remains in `.shamt/epics/requests/` until S1 creates the epic folder.**
