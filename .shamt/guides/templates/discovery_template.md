## Usage Notes

### When to Create

- **Stage:** S1.P3.1 (Initialize Discovery Document)
- **Trigger:** After S1 Step 2 (Epic Analysis) completes

### How to Update

- **During Discovery Loop:** Update after each iteration
- **After Discovery:** Only update if something is found incorrect or outdated
- **Post-Discovery updates:** Document in "Post-Discovery Updates" section

### Key Principles

1. **Source of Truth:** DISCOVERY.md is the epic-level source of truth for decisions
2. **Traceability:** Every recommendation ties to research findings or user answers
3. **Immutable (mostly):** After approval, only update to correct errors
4. **Referenced by Features:** Feature specs reference this document for shared context

### What Stays Here vs Feature Specs

| Content | Location | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Epic problem statement | DISCOVERY.md | Shared across features |
| Solution approach | DISCOVERY.md | Affects all features |
| User answers (scope/priorities) | DISCOVERY.md | Epic-level decisions |
| Scope boundaries | DISCOVERY.md | Epic-level |
| Feature breakdown rationale | DISCOVERY.md | Why these features |
| Feature-specific requirements | spec.md | Feature-specific |
| Feature implementation details | spec.md | Feature-specific |
| Feature acceptance criteria | spec.md | Feature-specific |
