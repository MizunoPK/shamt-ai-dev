## Template

```markdown
## Feature Spec Summary: {feature_name}

**Part of Epic:** {epic_name}
**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** {VALIDATED / DRAFT}

---

## Feature Description

{2-3 sentences describing what this specific feature does and why it's needed}

{Focus on OUTCOMES and USER VALUE, not implementation details}

{Example:}
This feature updates the accuracy simulation system to load player data from JSON files instead of CSV files. The JSON files contain week-by-week projected and actual points for all players across all 18 weeks of the season. This enables historical accuracy backtesting by comparing projected points (from week N) against actual points (from week N+1).

---

## What Users Will Be Able To Do

**After this feature, users can:**

- {User-facing capability 1}
- {User-facing capability 2}
- {User-facing capability 3}

{Example:}
- Run accuracy simulations using comprehensive JSON player data (not limited CSV data)
- Backtest accuracy across all 18 weeks of the 2025 season
- See realistic actual points (non-zero values) for all players in completed weeks
- Compare projected vs actual points for every player every week

---

## Technical Changes

**High-level technical changes (WHAT, not detailed HOW):**

- {High-level change 1 - what's being modified/added}
- {High-level change 2}
- {High-level change 3}

{Example:}
- Week offset logic implemented: week N loads projected from week_N folder, actual from week_N+1 folder
- JSON file loading replaces CSV loading in AccuracySimulationManager
- Player data structure updated to access week-specific points via getattr(player, f'week_{N}_points')
- All 18 weeks accessible (not just weeks 17-18)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**The feature is successful when ALL of these are true:**

- [ ] {Testable requirement 1}
- [ ] {Testable requirement 2}
- [ ] {Testable requirement 3}
- [ ] {Testable requirement 4}

{Add 5-8 acceptance criteria}

{Example:}
- [ ] All 18 weeks accessible with non-zero actual and projected points
- [ ] Week offset handled correctly (week N actual comes from week N+1 folder, not week N)
- [ ] AccuracySimulationManager loads JSON files (not CSV files)
- [ ] Player objects have week-specific points accessible via getattr()
- [ ] Simulation results comparable to CSV baseline (within 10% variance)
- [ ] All unit tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Smoke testing passes (import, entry point, E2E execution with data validation)

---

## Success Metrics

**Measurable indicators with thresholds:**

- {Measurable indicator 1 with threshold}
- {Measurable indicator 2 with threshold}
- {Measurable indicator 3 with threshold}

{Example:}
- Week coverage: 18/18 weeks accessible (100%)
- Data sanity: <10% of actual_points are 0.0 for completed weeks
- Variance check: std_dev > 0 for all player actual_points arrays
- Realistic range: All actual_points between 0-60 for typical players
- Performance: Simulation runtime within 10% of CSV baseline

## Failure Indicators

**These symptoms would mean the feature is BROKEN:**

❌ {Specific symptom that would mean feature is broken}
❌ {Another failure pattern}
❌ {Another failure pattern}

{Example:}
❌ >90% of actual_points are 0.0 (wrong week offset - loading week N instead of N+1)
❌ getattr(player, 'week_N_points') returns None (old API still used, consumption code not updated)
❌ Only weeks 17-18 work while weeks 1-16 have all zeros (week offset not generalized)
❌ Simulation crashes when loading JSON files
❌ Simulation results >50% different from CSV baseline (major logic error)

---

## Scope Boundaries

✅ **In Scope (What IS included in this feature):**
- {Item 1 included}
- {Item 2 included}
- {Item 3 included}

{Example:}
✅ JSON file loading for accuracy simulation (AccuracySimulationManager)
✅ Week offset logic for all 18 weeks
✅ Player data structure updates for week-specific access
✅ Unit tests and smoke tests for JSON loading

❌ **Out of Scope (What is NOT included in this feature):**
- {Item 1 NOT included}
- {Item 2 NOT included}
- {Item 3 NOT included}

{Example:}
❌ Win rate simulation updates (that's a separate feature)
❌ UI changes for displaying results
❌ JSON file generation (uses existing files)
❌ Support for seasons other than 2025

## Integration Points

**Where this feature touches other code:**

- {Integration point 1 - where this feature connects to other code}
- {Integration point 2}
- {Integration point 3}

{Example:}
- AccuracySimulationManager._load_player_data() - modified to use JSON loader
- PlayerManager (JSON loader) - provides week-specific player data
- ParallelAccuracyRunner - consumes updated player data from AccuracySimulationManager
- Feature 01 (win rate sim) - shares JSON loading patterns, must align on week offset logic

---

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites for this feature:**

- {Dependency 1}
- {Dependency 2}

{Example:}
- JSON player data files exist in simulation/sim_data/2025/weeks/week_{NN}/ folders
- PlayerManager supports JSON loading (if not, must implement)
- Week offset pattern understood (week N projected from week_N, actual from week_N+1)

## Notes

**Why this summary matters:**
This summary serves as source of truth for feature-level outcomes. It's created AFTER multi-phase research (S2) but BEFORE implementation (S5). During S5 v2 Validation Loop (Dimension 11: Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation), implementation_plan.md will be validated against spec.md, which was validated against this summary to catch misinterpretation.

**Historical context:**
Feature 02 catastrophic bug - spec.md stated "no code changes needed" for week 17/18 logic when it actually required week_N+1 offset for ALL weeks. If spec summary had existed with "week N+1 offset applies to ALL weeks" in Technical Changes, misinterpretation would have been obvious.

**Outcome-focused approach:**
- Spec summary describes WHAT the feature delivers, not detailed implementation
- Created after research (informed by codebase understanding)
- Provides high-level technical changes without premature implementation decisions
- Allows detailed design to happen in S5 (TODO creation)
