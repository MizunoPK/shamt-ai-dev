## Overview

**This process uses repeated rounds:** Repeat Rounds 1-3 until root cause confirmed (max 5 rounds total)

**Investigation Round Structure:**
- **Round 1:** Code Tracing & Root Cause Analysis (identify 2-3 suspicious areas)
- **Round 2:** Hypothesis Formation (max 3 testable hypotheses, ranked by likelihood)
- **Round 3:** Diagnostic Testing (test hypotheses, confirm root cause with evidence)

**Time Limits:**
- Max 2 hours per round (alert user if exceeded)
- Max 5 total rounds before user escalation

**Goal:** Confirm root cause with concrete evidence

**Model Selection for Token Optimization (SHAMT-27):**

Investigation rounds can save 30-40% tokens through delegation (same as debugging_protocol.md):

```text
Primary Agent (Opus - deep reasoning for root cause analysis):
├─ Spawn Haiku → Run diagnostic tests, verify file existence, read logs/stack traces
├─ Spawn Sonnet → Read implementation code, trace execution paths, identify suspicious areas
├─ Primary handles → Form hypotheses, rank likelihood, analyze test results, confirm root cause
├─ Primary writes → Investigation rounds documentation, issue file updates
└─ Primary proceeds → Solution design (PHASE 3) after root cause confirmed
```

**See:** `reference/model_selection.md` for Task tool examples.

## Before Starting Investigation

### Step 1: Update ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md

1. **Change issue status to 🟡 INVESTIGATING:**
   ```markdown
   | 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | 🟡 INVESTIGATING | Round 1 | ❌ NO | Smoke Part 3 | Starting investigation |
   ```

2. **Update "Current Focus" section:**
   ```markdown
   **Active Issue:** #1 (player_scoring_returns_null)
   **Current Phase:** Phase 2 (Investigation - Round 1)
   **Next Action:** Code tracing to identify suspicious areas
   ```

---

### Step 2: Create issue_{number}_{name}.md file

**Filename format:** `issue_01_player_scoring_returns_null.md`

Use template below (populated during investigation).

---

### Step 3: Create/Update investigation_rounds.md

**If first issue being investigated:**
Create `debugging/investigation_rounds.md`:

```markdown
## Investigation Rounds Tracker

**Feature/Epic:** {name}
**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

---

## Active Investigations

| Issue # | Issue Name | Current Round | Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | Round 1 | Code tracing in progress |

---

## Completed Investigations

{Empty initially - will populate as investigations complete}

---

## Investigation Statistics

**Total Investigations:** 1 active, 0 complete
**Average Rounds per Issue:** N/A
**Total Investigation Time:** {tracking}
```

**If investigation_rounds.md already exists:**
Add new issue to "Active Investigations" table.

---

## Issue File Template: issue_{number}_{name}.md

```markdown
## Issue #1: Item scoring returns None

**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Status:** INVESTIGATING
**Discovered During:** Smoke Testing Part 3 (E2E Test)
**Current Phase:** Investigation Round 1

---

## Issue Description

**Symptom:**
Item scoring calculation returns None instead of expected float value

**Discovered During:**
S7.P1 Smoke Testing Part 3 - E2E test execution

**Reproduction:**
```
item = RecordManager.load_item("Record-A")
score = item.calculate_score(week=1)
## Expected: 24.5 (float)
## Actual: None
```markdown

**Impact:**
Blocks feature functionality - cannot calculate item scores

**Test Output:**
```
AssertionError: Expected float, got None
  File: {module}/{ClassName}.py:{line_number}
```markdown

## Round 1: Code Tracing & Root Cause Analysis

**Goal:** Trace execution path, identify 2-3 suspicious code areas

**Time Limit:** 2 hours max (alert user if exceeded)

---

### Steps

#### 1. Trace execution path from symptom backwards

**Start where error occurs** (test failure point):
- Review stack trace
- Identify the file and line where error appears
- Note the exact error message

**Follow call stack backwards:**
- What function/method called this?
- What called that function?
- Continue until you reach the entry point

**Document each function/method:**
- Function name
- File location (file:line)
- What data is passed in
- What data is returned

**Note data transformations:**
- Where does data originate?
- How is it transformed at each step?
- Where might it become None/null/incorrect?

---

#### 2. Identify suspicious areas

**Narrow to 2-3 specific code locations:**
- File path and line numbers
- Function/method names
- Why is this location suspicious?

**For each suspicious area, note:**
- What does this code do?
- What data does it expect?
- What data is it actually receiving?
- Could this cause the symptom?

---

#### 3. Document in issue_{number}_{name}.md

**Add Round 1 section:**

```markdown
### Round 1: Code Tracing & Root Cause Analysis ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM})

**Execution Path Traced:**
```
AccuracySimulationManager.run()
  → RecordManager.load_item("Record-A")
    → DataRecord.__init__()
      → DataRecord._load_stats()
        → DataRecord._calculate_base_score()  ← Returns None
```bash

**Findings:**
- DataRecord._calculate_base_score() is returning None
- Method expects self.stats to be populated
- self.stats appears to be empty dict {}
- Suspect: Stats not loading from CSV during __init__

**Suspicious Code Locations:**
1. utils/DataRecord.py:156 - _load_stats() method
   - Responsible for loading item stats from CSV
   - If CSV load fails, self.stats stays empty
2. utils/DataRecord.py:89 - _calculate_base_score() method
   - Returns None if self.stats is empty
   - No error raised, just returns None silently
3. data/item_stats.csv - Data source
   - CSV might be missing or have wrong format
   - Column names might not match expected

**Data Flow:**
- CSV file → pd.read_csv() → filter by item name → self.stats dict
- If any step fails, self.stats = {}
- Empty dict → calculate_base_score() returns None

**Preliminary Hypothesis:**
CSV not loading correctly, leaving self.stats empty

**Next:** Round 2 - Form specific testable hypotheses
```

---

#### 4. Update investigation_rounds.md

```markdown
## Active Investigations

| Issue # | Issue Name | Current Round | Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | Round 1 Complete | Identified 3 suspicious areas |
```

---

#### 5. Update ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md

```markdown
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | 🟡 INVESTIGATING | Round 1 → Round 2 | ❌ NO | Smoke Part 3 | 3 suspicious areas found |
```

---

## Round 2: Hypothesis Formation

**Goal:** Form 1-3 specific TESTABLE hypotheses

**Time Limit:** 2 hours max

**Max Hypotheses:** 3 (prevents shotgun debugging)

---

### Steps

#### 1. Review Round 1 findings

- Re-read execution path
- Re-read suspicious code locations
- Consider what could cause the symptom

---

#### 2. Form ranked hypotheses

**Each hypothesis must be:**
- **Specific:** Names exact cause (not vague guesses)
- **Testable:** Can be confirmed/rejected with diagnostic logging or tests
- **Explanatory:** Explains how it would cause the symptom

**Rank by likelihood:**
- Hypothesis 1: Most likely (60-80% confidence)
- Hypothesis 2: Possible (20-40% confidence)
- Hypothesis 3: Less likely but worth testing (5-20% confidence)

**For each hypothesis, specify:**
- **Root Cause:** Exact technical cause
- **Why it explains symptom:** How this would lead to observed behavior
- **How to test:** What diagnostic logging or tests will confirm/reject
- **Expected evidence:** What you'd see in logs if this is the cause

---

#### 3. Design diagnostic logging plan

**What data to inspect?**
- Variable values at suspicious code locations
- Data coming from external sources (CSV, API, config)
- Data transformations (before/after)

**Where to add log statements?**
- At each suspicious code location from Round 1
- At data transformation points
- At decision branches

**What test scenarios?**
- Reproduce original bug scenario
- Test with different inputs
- Test with edge cases

---

#### 4. Document in issue_{number}_{name}.md

**Add Round 2 section:**

```markdown
### Round 2: Hypothesis Formation ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM})

**Hypotheses (ranked by likelihood):**

**HYPOTHESIS 1: CSV Column Name Mismatch** (Confidence: 70%)
- **Root Cause:** _load_stats() expects column 'stat_value' but CSV has 'StatValue'
- **Why it explains symptom:** Column mismatch → pd filtering fails → stats dict stays empty → calculate returns None
- **How to test:** Add logging to show CSV columns and parsed dict contents
- **Expected evidence:** Log shows column names don't match expected, parsed dict is empty

**HYPOTHESIS 2: Item Name Mismatch** (Confidence: 20%)
- **Root Cause:** CSV uses "P. Mahomes" but we're looking up "Record-A"
- **Why it explains symptom:** Name mismatch → no rows match filter → empty dict → None
- **How to test:** Add logging to show item name in CSV vs lookup name
- **Expected evidence:** Log shows name format mismatch between CSV and lookup

**HYPOTHESIS 3: File Path Wrong** (Confidence: 10%)
- **Root Cause:** _load_stats() looking in wrong directory for CSV
- **Why it explains symptom:** File not found → empty DataFrame → empty dict → None
- **How to test:** Add logging to show full file path being accessed
- **Expected evidence:** Log shows FileNotFoundError or wrong path

**Diagnostic Logging Plan:**
```
## Add to utils/DataRecord.py:156 (_load_stats method)
logger.info(f"Loading stats from: {csv_path}")
logger.info(f"CSV columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")
logger.info(f"CSV shape: {df.shape}")
logger.info(f"Looking for item: {self.name}")
logger.info(f"Items in CSV: {df['ItemName'].unique()[:5]}")  # First 5
logger.info(f"Stats after filter: {player_stats.shape}")
logger.info(f"Parsed stats dict: {self.stats}")
```markdown

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Load "Record-A" (current failing case)
2. Load different item to see if pattern repeats
3. Check if CSV file exists and is readable
4. Inspect CSV manually to verify format

**Next:** Round 3 - Add logging and test hypotheses
```

---

#### 5. Update investigation_rounds.md and ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md

```markdown
## Active Investigations

| Issue # | Issue Name | Current Round | Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | Round 2 Complete | 3 hypotheses formed |
```

```markdown
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | 🟡 INVESTIGATING | Round 2 → Round 3 | ❌ NO | Smoke Part 3 | 3 hypotheses ready to test |
```

---

## Round 3: Diagnostic Testing

**Goal:** Test hypotheses, confirm root cause with evidence

**Time Limit:** 2 hours max

---

### Steps

#### 1. Add diagnostic logging

Implement the diagnostic logging plan from Round 2:
- Add log statements at suspicious code locations
- Log variable values, data inputs/outputs, decision paths
- Use INFO level (not DEBUG) so logs appear by default

---

#### 2. Run test scenarios

Execute the test scenarios from Round 2:
- Reproduce the original bug
- Test with variations
- Collect log output

---

#### 3. Collect and save log output

```bash
## Save to debugging/diagnostic_logs/
cp output.log debugging/diagnostic_logs/issue_01_round3.log

## Or capture programmatically
python [run_script].py --mode accuracy 2>&1 | tee debugging/diagnostic_logs/issue_01_round3.log
```

---

#### 4. Analyze results

**For each hypothesis:**
- Review log output
- Does evidence CONFIRM or REJECT hypothesis?
- What was unexpected?
- Which hypothesis has strongest evidence?

**Root cause confirmation criteria:**
- Hypothesis explains ALL symptoms
- Evidence is concrete (not circumstantial)
- Fix for this cause would resolve issue

---

#### 5. Document in issue_{number}_{name}.md

**Add Round 3 section:**

```markdown
### Round 3: Diagnostic Testing ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM})

**Changes Made:**
- Added diagnostic logging to utils/DataRecord.py:156-162

**Test Run Output:**
```
INFO: Loading stats from: data/item_stats.csv
INFO: CSV columns: ['Week', 'PlayerName', 'StatValue', 'Position']
INFO: CSV shape: (544, 4)
INFO: Looking for item: Record-A
INFO: Items in CSV: ['Record-A', 'J.Allen', 'L.Jackson', 'J.Herbert', 'D.Prescott']
INFO: Stats after filter: (0, 4)
INFO: Parsed stats dict: {}
```markdown

**Analysis:**

**Hypothesis 1 (Column Mismatch):** ❌ REJECTED
- Evidence: CSV columns match expected (['PlayerName', 'StatValue'] exist)
- No column mismatch

**Hypothesis 2 (Item Name Mismatch):** ✅ CONFIRMED
- Evidence: CSV has 'Record-A' but we're looking up 'Record-A'
- Filtered DataFrame has 0 rows (no match)
- This explains why stats dict is empty
- Empty dict → calculate_base_score() returns None
- **This is the root cause**

**Hypothesis 3 (File Path):** ❌ REJECTED
- Evidence: CSV loads successfully (has 544 rows)
- File path is correct

---

**ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:**

**Problem:** Item name format mismatch
- Code uses: "Record-A"
- CSV has: "Record-A"
- Lookup fails → empty stats dict → calculate_base_score() returns None

**Location:** utils/DataRecord.py:156 (_load_stats method)

**Evidence:** Diagnostic logs (saved to debugging/diagnostic_logs/issue_01_round3.log)

**Status:** Ready for Phase 3 (Solution Design & Implementation)

**Investigation Summary:**
- Rounds: 3
- Time: ~90 minutes
- Root cause confirmed with concrete evidence
```

---

#### 6. Update ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md

```markdown
| 1 | player_scoring_returns_null | 🟡 INVESTIGATING | Phase 2 → Phase 3 | ❌ NO | Smoke Part 3 | Root cause confirmed |
```

---

## Round Limits & Escalation

### If root cause NOT found after Round 3

**Assess:**
- Are there new hypotheses to test? → Back to Round 2
- Do you need to expand the search area? → Back to Round 1
- **Max 5 total rounds** before user escalation

---

### After 5 rounds without confirming root cause

**Escalate to user:**

```markdown
I've completed 5 investigation rounds for Issue #{number} without confirming the root cause.

## Investigation Summary

**Issue:** {name}
**Rounds:** 5
**Time:** {total time}

**What I've Tried:**

## Common Investigation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Data Format Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Data loads but values are wrong
- Empty results when data exists
- Type mismatches

**Investigation approach:**
- Log data formats at boundaries (CSV, API, config)
- Compare expected vs actual formats
- Check column names, data types, encoding

---

### Pattern 2: Null/None Propagation

**Symptoms:**
- Null/None appearing where not expected
- Silent failures (no errors raised)

**Investigation approach:**
- Trace data flow backwards from None value
- Find where None originates
- Check why validation didn't catch it

---

### Pattern 3: Integration Mismatch

**Symptoms:**
- Works in isolation, fails when integrated
- Data lost between components

**Investigation approach:**
- Log data at integration boundaries
- Verify interfaces match (caller sends what callee expects)
- Check for version mismatches in shared data structures

---

## Next Steps

**After confirming root cause (Round 3 complete):**

✅ Root cause identified with concrete evidence
✅ Diagnostic logs saved
✅ Issue file updated with investigation results
✅ ISSUES_CHECKLIST.md updated

**Next:** Read `debugging/resolution.md` for PHASE 3 (Solution Design & Implementation)
