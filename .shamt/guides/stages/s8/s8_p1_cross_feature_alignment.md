# S8: Post-Feature Alignment
## S8.P1: Cross-Feature Spec Alignment

**File:** `s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md`

**Purpose:** After completing a feature, review ALL remaining (not-yet-implemented) feature specs to ensure they align with the ACTUAL implementation (not just the plan). Update specs based on real insights from implementation to prevent spec drift and catch cascading changes early.

**Stage Flow Context:**
```text
S5 (Implementation Planning) → S6 (Implementation Execution) → S7 (Testing & Review) →
→ [YOU ARE HERE: S8.P1 - Cross-Feature Alignment] →
→ S8.P2 (Testing Plan Update) → Next Feature's S5 (or S9 if all features done)
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL

**BEFORE starting Cross-Feature Alignment — including when resuming a prior session — you MUST:**

1. **Use the phase transition prompt** from `prompts_reference_v2.md`
   - Find "Starting S8.P1" prompt
   - Speak it out loud (acknowledge requirements)
   - List critical requirements from this guide

2. **Update README Agent Status** with:
   - Current Phase: CROSS_FEATURE_ALIGNMENT
   - Current Guide: stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md
   - Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
   - Critical Rules: "Compare to ACTUAL implementation", "Update specs proactively", "Mark features needing rework"
   - Next Action: Review feature_01 spec (first remaining feature)

3. **Verify all prerequisites** (see checklist below)

4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** begin Cross-Feature Alignment workflow

**This is NOT optional.** Reading this guide ensures you don't miss critical spec updates.

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Skip checking remaining feature specs because "the changes were minor" — ALL not-yet-implemented feature specs must be reviewed against the ACTUAL implementation, regardless of perceived change scope
- Skip Step 5 (Alignment Validation Loop) because "no spec changes were needed" — the validation loop must run to confirm zero conflicts, even when no changes are required

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

---

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
Post-Feature Alignment is where you update remaining feature specs based on the just-completed feature's actual implementation, ensuring pending features align with real code patterns and integration points discovered during development.

**When do you use this guide?**
- S7 (Testing & Review) complete (feature fully validated and production-ready)
- There are remaining features to implement
- Ready to align pending specs with completed work

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ Completed feature reviewed (actual implementation understood)
- ✅ Alignment impacts identified (which specs need updates)
- ✅ Remaining feature specs updated with implementation insights
- ✅ Integration points documented
- ✅ Ready for S8.P2

**Time Estimate:**
15-30 minutes per completed feature

**Exit Condition:**
Post-Feature Alignment is complete when all remaining feature specs are updated to reflect actual implementation patterns, integration points are documented, and updates are logged in each affected spec

---

## 🛑 Critical Rules

```text
1. ⚠️ REVIEW ALL REMAINING FEATURES (Not just "related" ones)
   - Don't assume which features are affected
   - Implementation insights can affect unexpected features
   - Review EVERY feature that hasn't completed S7 (Testing & Review) yet
   - Sequentially go through all remaining features

2. ⚠️ COMPARE TO ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION (Not the plan)
   - Don't compare to original TODO or plan
   - Look at ACTUAL code that was written
   - Check ACTUAL interfaces created
   - Verify ACTUAL data structures used
   - Review ACTUAL integration patterns implemented

3. ⚠️ UPDATE SPECS PROACTIVELY (Don't wait for implementation)
   - If spec assumptions wrong → update NOW
   - If interface changed → update dependent specs NOW
   - If data structure different → update dependent features NOW
   - Don't defer updates to "we'll figure it out during implementation"

4. ⚠️ MARK FEATURES NEEDING SIGNIFICANT REWORK
   - Use clear criteria (see below)
   - If feature needs >3 new implementation tasks → return to S5
   - If spec assumptions fundamentally wrong → return to S2
   - If feature should be split/removed → return to S1
   - Document WHY rework needed

5. ⚠️ DOCUMENT INSIGHTS IN SPEC
   - Don't just update spec silently
   - Add "Updated based on {feature_name} implementation" note
   - Explain WHY spec changed
   - Reference actual code locations that drove update

6. ⚠️ UPDATE CHECKLIST.MD TOO
   - Don't just update spec.md
   - Update corresponding checklist.md items
   - Mark any resolved questions/decisions
   - Add new questions if implementation revealed unknowns

7. ⚠️ CHECK DEPENDENCIES (Both directions)
   - Features that DEPEND on just-completed feature (downstream)
   - Features that just-completed feature DEPENDS on (upstream)
   - Shared interfaces, data structures, configuration
   - Integration points and workflows

8. ⚠️ NO "PROBABLY FINE" ASSUMPTIONS
   - If unsure if spec needs updating → READ THE ACTUAL CODE
   - If unsure if interface changed → CHECK THE ACTUAL CLASS
   - Don't assume → verify
   - 5 minutes checking saves hours of rework

9. ⚠️ UPDATE EPIC README
   - Document alignment check completion
   - Note any features marked for rework
   - Update epic status if significant changes needed

10. ⚠️ GET USER APPROVAL FOR SIGNIFICANT REWORK
    - If any feature needs to return to S2 or 1 → ask user
    - Present: What changed, why rework needed, proposed approach
    - Don't proceed with major changes without user sign-off
```

## Critical Decisions Summary

**S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment) has 1 major decision point per remaining feature:**

### Decision Point (Per Feature): Spec Update Classification (UPDATE/REWORK/NO CHANGE)
**Question:** After comparing spec to actual implementation, what level of change is needed?

**Classification criteria:**

**Option A: NO CHANGE**
- Spec assumptions were correct
- Actual implementation matches spec expectations
- No cascading effects from completed feature
- ✅ Mark feature as "Reviewed - No changes needed"
- Proceed to next remaining feature

**Option B: MINOR UPDATE (update spec now, continue normally)**
- Spec assumptions slightly off but fixable with spec edits
- Changes are clarifications, not fundamental shifts
- Examples: Interface signature slightly different, data structure naming changed
- **Action:** Update spec.md and checklist.md NOW with actual implementation details
- ✅ Mark feature as "Spec updated based on {completed_feature}"
- Proceed to next remaining feature

**Option C: SIGNIFICANT REWORK REQUIRED (return to earlier stage)**
- Spec assumptions fundamentally wrong
- Completed feature revealed major gaps or conflicts
- **Criteria for REWORK:**
  - >3 new implementation tasks needed
  - Core algorithm approach no longer valid
  - Data dependencies changed fundamentally
  - Feature should be split or removed
- **Action based on severity:**
  - Return to S5 (Implementation Planning) if >3 new tasks
  - Return to S2 (Deep Dive) if spec fundamentally wrong
  - Return to S1 (Epic Planning) if feature should be split/removed
- ❌ Mark feature as "REQUIRES REWORK - {reason}"
- Document WHY rework needed
- Get user approval before proceeding

**Impact:** Deferring spec updates to "during implementation" causes rework. Updating specs NOW based on actual implementation prevents cascading failures.

---

**Summary of Alignment Review:**
- Review ALL remaining features (not just "related" ones)
- Compare to ACTUAL implementation (not the plan)
- Classify EACH feature: NO CHANGE / MINOR UPDATE / REWORK
- Update specs proactively (don't defer to implementation)
- Get user approval for any REWORK classifications

---

---

## Step 2.5: Check Remaining Feature's implementation_plan.md (If It Exists)

**This step is conditional.** Only runs when a remaining feature has an `implementation_plan.md` — i.e., S5 was completed in parallel mode during this epic.

**Check:** `{remaining_feature_folder}/implementation_plan.md`
- If file does not exist: skip this step entirely for that feature
- If file exists: proceed with the checks below

### What to Check

Read the remaining feature's `implementation_plan.md` and compare it against the just-completed feature's actual code, focusing on these four dimensions:

**D2 — Interface assertions:**
Does the plan assert that certain functions, classes, or modules exist with specific signatures?
- Example: "will call `process_records(items: list[Record]) -> Summary`"
- Check: Does the just-completed feature's actual code match this signature?

**D5 — Cross-feature data flow assumptions:**
Does the plan read from or write to data produced or consumed by the just-completed feature?
- Example: "reads `results.json` with field `score`"
- Check: Does the just-completed feature's output actually use that field name and structure?

**D6 — Error handling assumptions:**
Does the plan assume a specific error-handling pattern from the completed feature?
- Example: "calls raise_if_invalid() which raises ValueError on bad input"
- Check: Is that still the actual behavior?

**D7 — Integration assumptions:**
Does the plan assume a specific integration behavior (module layout, import path, initialization sequence)?
- Check: Does the completed feature match those assumptions?

### Classification

After checking, classify the remaining feature's plan:

| Classification | Criteria | Action |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **NO CHANGE** | All D2/D5/D6/D7 assumptions still accurate | Mark plan as reviewed, no update needed |
| **MINOR PLAN UPDATE** | One or two assumptions changed; fixable inline | Update plan directly; run targeted re-validation (see below) |
| **SIGNIFICANT PLAN REWORK** | Core approach or multiple assumptions invalidated | Add re-review flag to plan; notify user; do not attempt to fix now |
| **SPEC UPDATE NEEDED** | Discrepancy is at spec level (not just plan level) | STOP — escalate to user; return to S2 or update spec |

### Actions After Classification

**NO CHANGE:**
Add a note to `implementation_plan.md`:
```
Reviewed at S8 against {completed_feature_name} implementation — no changes needed. [{date}]
```

**MINOR PLAN UPDATE:**
1. Update the affected section(s) of `implementation_plan.md` directly
2. Add note: `Updated at S8 against {completed_feature_name}: {brief reason}. [{date}]`
3. Run targeted re-validation on affected dimensions:
   - Re-read the updated plan
   - Check D2, D5, D6, D7 against the completed feature's code
   - Confirm the update resolves the discrepancy without introducing new issues
   - This is a focused check, not a full S5 re-run

**SIGNIFICANT PLAN REWORK:**
1. Add a prominent flag to the top of `implementation_plan.md`:
   ```
   ⚠️ REQUIRES REVIEW BEFORE S6: Plan assumptions may be invalid.
   Flagged at S8 against {completed_feature_name} implementation. [{date}]
   Reason: {brief description of what changed}
   ```
2. Notify user: describe what changed and why the plan needs review
3. Do NOT attempt to update the plan now — the scope may require a full S5 re-run

**SPEC UPDATE NEEDED:**
1. STOP — do not update the plan
2. Escalate to user immediately: describe the exact spec-level discrepancy
3. Wait for user decision (update spec? re-run S2? accept current behavior?)

### Documentation

Add a "Step 2.5" entry to the `S8_ALIGNMENT_VALIDATION_{feature_NN}.md` file:

```markdown
## Step 2.5: implementation_plan.md Check

**Feature:** {remaining_feature_folder}
**Plan exists:** Yes / No (skip if No)

**Dimensions checked:** D2, D5, D6, D7
**Classification:** {NO CHANGE | MINOR PLAN UPDATE | SIGNIFICANT PLAN REWORK | SPEC UPDATE NEEDED}
**Findings:** {description, or "None"}
**Action taken:** {description, or "None — plan marked as reviewed"}
```

---

## Step 5: Alignment Validation Loop (MANDATORY)

**After updating remaining feature specs, validate changes with iterative loop.**

**Goal:** Achieve primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation with ZERO issues in updated specs

**When to run:**
- After EACH feature completes implementation (S6-S7)
- After S8.P1 updates remaining feature specs

**Loop Process:**
1. Review ALL specs updated in S8.P1
2. Use focused validation perspective:
   - **Loop 1 - Alignment Checker:** Verify remaining specs align with implemented feature's patterns
   - **Loop 2 - Implementation Consistency:** Check for contradictions between specs and implementation
3. Find issues (misalignments, contradictions, missing updates)
4. Resolve ALL issues (zero tolerance standard)
5. **Exit condition:** primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation (ZERO issues found)

**Differences from S3 Validation Loop:**
- **S3:** 3 loops, ALL specs, BEFORE implementation (comprehensive)
- **S8.P1:** 2 loops, UPDATED specs, AFTER each feature (incremental)
- **Both:** Zero tolerance for issues (all severities must be resolved)

**Why this matters:**
- S8.P1 updates can introduce new inconsistencies
- Issues caught immediately instead of after all features complete
- Prevents cascading alignment problems across remaining features
- Maintains consistency throughout implementation (not just at S3)

**Time Investment:**
- 2 loops: ~15-30 minutes per feature
- Prevents downstream rework: Saves 1-2 hours

**Documentation:**
Create `S8_ALIGNMENT_VALIDATION_{feature_NN}.md` with:
- Loop 1 results (perspective, issues found, resolutions)
- Loop 2 results (should be 0 issues if Loop 1 was thorough)
- Exit confirmation: primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved

**Example from SHAMT-7:**
After Feature 01 implementation:
- S8.P1: Updated Features 02-07 specs
- Validation Loop 1: Found 2 issues (missing error handling pattern, old logging approach)
- Resolved issues
- Validation Loop 2: 0 issues found
- Proceed to S8.P2 with confirmed alignment

## 🛑 MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 1

**You are about to declare S8.P1 complete**

⚠️ STOP - DO NOT PROCEED TO S8.P2 YET

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read "Critical Rules" section at top of this guide
2. [ ] Verify you compared to ACTUAL implementation (not implementation_plan.md)
3. [ ] Verify you updated specs PROACTIVELY (not just noted issues)
4. [ ] Verify ALL remaining features were reviewed (not just "related" ones)
5. [ ] Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status:
   - Current Guide: "stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md"

- Update test scenarios based on ACTUAL implementation of just-completed feature
- Add integration points discovered during implementation
- Keep testing plan current as epic evolves

**Next step:** Read stages/s8/s8_p2_epic_testing_update.md and use phase transition prompt

---

## Summary

**S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment) ensures remaining feature specs align with implementation reality through:**

1. **Comprehensive Review** - ALL remaining features reviewed (not just "related" ones)
2. **Actual Implementation Comparison** - Compare specs to ACTUAL code (not plans)
3. **Proactive Updates** - Update specs NOW (before implementation) to reflect reality
4. **Significant Rework Identification** - Clear criteria for routing features back to appropriate stage
5. **User Approval for Major Changes** - Get sign-off before major rework

**Critical protocols:**
- Review ALL remaining features sequentially
- Compare to ACTUAL implementation (read the code)
- Update specs proactively (don't defer)
- Use clear rework criteria (S1, S2, or S5)
- Get user approval for major changes

**Success criteria:**
- All remaining features reviewed
- All needed spec updates applied
- Features needing rework properly marked and routed
- Epic documentation current
- Ready for S8.P2

**Why this matters:** Plans change during implementation. Code reveals insights specs couldn't predict. S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment) keeps remaining features aligned with reality, preventing costly rework during implementation.
