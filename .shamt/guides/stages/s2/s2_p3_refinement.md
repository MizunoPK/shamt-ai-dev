## Overview

**What is this phase?**
Refinement Phase is where you resolve all open questions through interactive dialogue (ONE at a time), adjust scope if needed, align with completed features, and get user approval on acceptance criteria. This phase ensures the spec is complete, validated, and ready for implementation.

**When do you use this guide?**
- S2.P2 (Specification Phase) complete
- spec.md has Discovery Context section and requirement traceability
- checklist.md has open questions
- Phase 2.5 (Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check) passed

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ All checklist questions resolved (zero open items)
- ✅ Spec updated in real-time after each answer
- ✅ Feature scope validated (not too large, properly scoped)
- ✅ Cross-feature alignment complete (no conflicts with other features)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria created and user-approved

**Time Estimate:**
1-2 hours per feature (depends on number of questions and feature complexity)

**Exit Condition:**
Refinement Phase is complete when all checklist questions are resolved, scope is validated, cross-feature alignment is done, and user has approved acceptance criteria

**Examples:** For detailed examples and templates, see `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md`

---

## Critical Rules

**📖 See:** `reference/critical_workflow_rules.md` for complete rules

**Key Rules Summary:**
1. ⚠️ ONE question at a time (NEVER batch)
2. ⚠️ Investigation complete ≠ Question resolved (user approval required)
3. ⚠️ Update spec/checklist IMMEDIATELY
4. ⚠️ Cross-feature alignment MANDATORY
5. ⚠️ Acceptance criteria require USER APPROVAL
6. ⚠️ Every answer creates requirement with traceability

**Copy full rules from reference file to README Agent Status before starting this phase.**

---

## Critical Decisions Summary

**This phase has ONE critical decision point:**

### Decision Point: Phase 6 - User Approval (MANDATORY)

**Question:** Does user approve acceptance criteria?
- **If YES:** Mark approval timestamp, proceed to mark feature complete
- **If NO:** Update spec based on feedback, re-present for approval
- **Impact:** Cannot proceed to S3 or implementation without user approval

---

## 🔄 Parallel Work Coordination (If Applicable)

**Skip this section if in sequential mode**

**If in parallel S2 work mode:**

### Coordination Heartbeat (Every 15 Minutes)

1. **Update checkpoint:** `agent_checkpoints/{agent_id}.json` (crash recovery)
2. **Check inbox:** `agent_comms/` for messages (process UNREAD, mark READ)
3. **Update STATUS:** `feature_{N}_{name}/STATUS` (stage, phase, blockers)
4. **Update EPIC_README.md:** Acquire lock, update your section, release lock

### Escalation Protocol

**If blocked >30 minutes:** Send escalation to Primary (SLA: 15-minute response)

**Primary responsibilities:** Check all secondary inboxes every 15 min, respond to escalations, monitor staleness

### Completion Signal (After S2.P3)

1. Send completion message to Primary
2. Update STATUS: `STATUS: COMPLETE`, `READY_FOR_SYNC: true`
3. Update checkpoint: `status: "WAITING_FOR_SYNC"`
4. **WAIT for Primary to run S3** (do NOT proceed yourself)

**See:** `parallel_work/s2_parallel_protocol.md` for complete workflow

---

---

---

---

## Phase 3: Interactive Question Resolution

**Goal:** Resolve ALL checklist questions ONE AT A TIME

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This is the heart of the refinement phase. Do NOT batch questions. Ask one, wait, update, then ask next.

---

### Step 3.1: Select Next Question

**Priority order:**
1. **Blocking questions** - Must be answered before other questions make sense
2. **High-impact questions** - Affect algorithm or data structure design
3. **Low-impact questions** - Implementation details

**How to identify priority:**
- Read all open questions in checklist.md
- Identify dependencies (some questions depend on others)
- Start with questions that unlock other questions

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 3 Examples for question prioritization examples

---

### Step 3.2: Ask ONE Question

**Format:**

```markdown
I have a question about Feature {N} ({Name}):

## Question {N}: {Title}

**Context:** {Why this matters, what we're trying to accomplish}

**Options:**

A. **{Option A}**
   - Pros: {benefits}
   - Cons: {drawbacks}

B. **{Option B}**
   - Pros: {benefits}
   - Cons: {drawbacks}

C. **{Option C}**
   - Pros: {benefits}
   - Cons: {drawbacks}

**My recommendation:** Option {X} because {reason}

**What do you prefer?** (or suggest a different approach)
```

**🚨 MANDATORY requirements for every question:**
- Provide 2-4 well-defined options with pros/cons for each
- **Always state your recommendation explicitly** ("My recommendation: Option X because...")
  - You have already done the research — withholding a recommendation forces the user to repeat it
  - A recommendation does NOT remove user agency; the user still makes the final call
  - Anti-pattern: listing options with no recommendation ("Which do you prefer?") is incomplete work
- Allow user to suggest alternative approaches
- Keep context brief but informative

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 3 Examples for complete question-answer cycles

---

### Step 3.3: WAIT for User Answer

⚠️ **STOP HERE - Do NOT proceed without user answer**

**Do NOT:**
- Ask multiple questions in one message
- Proceed to next question while waiting
- Make assumptions about what user will choose
- Continue working on other phases

**DO:**
- Wait for user response
- Be ready to answer follow-up questions
- Be ready to present additional options if user asks

**Update Agent Status:**
```markdown
**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Current Phase:** DEEP_DIVE
**Current Step:** Phase 3 - Waiting for answer to Question {N}
**Current Guide:** stages/s2/s2_p3_refinement.md
**Guide Last Read:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Critical Rules from Guide:**
- ONE question at a time
- Update immediately after answer
- Wait for user before proceeding

**Progress:** {M}/{N} questions resolved
**Next Action:** Wait for user answer to Question {current_question_number}
**Blockers:** Waiting for user input on {question_topic}
```

---

### Step 3.4: Update Spec & Checklist Immediately

**After user answers**, update files IMMEDIATELY (before asking next question):

**Update checklist.md:**
```markdown
### Question {N}: {Title}
- [x] **RESOLVED:** {User's choice}

**User's Answer:**
{Paste user's exact answer or paraphrase}

**Implementation Impact:**
- {How this affects the implementation}
- {What needs to be added to spec}
- {Any new questions this creates}
```

**Update spec.md:**

Add requirement with new source:

```markdown
### Requirement {N}: {Name}

**Description:** {What this requirement does}

**Source:** User Answer to Question {N} (checklist.md)
**Traceability:** User confirmed preference on {date}

**Implementation:**
{Details based on user's answer}

**Technical Details:**
- {Specific implementation notes}
- {Edge cases to handle}
- {Dependencies or prerequisites}
```

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 3 Examples for complete update examples

---

### Step 3.5: Evaluate for New Questions

**After updating files, ask:**
- Did this answer create NEW questions?
- Did this answer resolve OTHER questions?
- Do we need clarification on any part of the answer?

**Update checklist.md if needed:**
- Add new questions that arose from answer
- Mark other questions resolved if answer made them N/A
- Document dependencies between questions

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 3 Examples for question evaluation examples

---

### Step 3.6: Repeat Until ALL Questions Resolved

Continue asking questions ONE AT A TIME until checklist shows:

```markdown
**Checklist Status:** 0 open questions, {N} resolved
```

**After each question, follow this cycle:**
1. Ask ONE question (Step 3.2)
2. Wait for answer (Step 3.3)
3. Update spec & checklist immediately (Step 3.4)
4. Evaluate for new questions (Step 3.5)
5. Select next question (Step 3.1)
6. Repeat

**Update Agent Status after each question:**
```markdown
**Progress:** Phase 3 - Question {M}/{N} answered ({M} resolved, {remaining} open)
**Next Action:** Ask Question {M+1}
**Blockers:** None
```

**When all questions resolved:**
```markdown
**Progress:** Phase 3 - COMPLETE (all {N} questions resolved)
**Next Action:** Phase 4 - Dynamic Scope Adjustment
**Blockers:** None
```

---

## Phase 4: Dynamic Scope Adjustment

**Goal:** Ensure feature scope is reasonable and properly categorized

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Features with >35 checklist items become unmaintainable. Split if needed.

---

### Step 4.1: Count Checklist Items

**Count all resolved and open items in checklist.md**

**Document the count:**
```markdown
**Checklist Item Count:** {total} items ({resolved} resolved, {open} open)
```

---

### Step 4.2: Evaluate Feature Size

**Decision tree:**

**If checklist has >35 items:**
- ✋ **STOP** - Feature is too large
- Action: Propose split into multiple features
- Requirement: Get user approval before splitting
- Next: Step 4.3 (Propose Split)

**If checklist has 20-35 items:**
- ✅ **OK** - Feature is appropriately sized
- Action: Document as "medium complexity"
- Next: Step 4.4 (Check for New Work)

**If checklist has <20 items:**
- ✅ **OK** - Feature is reasonably sized
- Action: Document as "straightforward"
- Next: Step 4.4 (Check for New Work)

**Update Agent Status:**
```markdown
**Progress:** Phase 4 - Scope evaluation ({total} checklist items)
**Next Action:** {Propose split / Check for new work}
**Blockers:** None
```

---

### Step 4.3: Propose Feature Split (If >35 Items)

**If checklist >35 items, present split proposal to user**

**Use format from:** `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 4 Examples → Feature Too Large

**If user approves split:**
- Document approval in current feature README.md
- Return to S1 (Epic Planning) to restructure
- Create new feature folders
- Split spec and checklist content
- Update epic EPIC_README.md
- Resume S2 for each new feature

**If user rejects split:**
- Document user decision to keep as single feature
- Note in feature README.md: "User approved large scope ({total} items)"
- Proceed to Step 4.4
- Be aware of increased implementation complexity

---

### Step 4.4: Check for New Work Discovered

**During question resolution, you may have discovered new work not in original epic**

**Decision tree for new work:**

**Option A: New work is independent subsystem**
- Example: "We need a new CSV parser module"
- **Action:** Propose as NEW FEATURE (separate from current feature)
- **Rationale:** Independent subsystems should be their own features
- **Next:** Present to user, if approved return to S1

**Option B: New work extends current feature**
- Example: "We need to add logging to the data loader"
- **Action:** Add to current feature's spec (expanded scope)
- **Rationale:** These are implementation details, not separate features
- **Next:** Update spec.md and checklist.md, continue with current feature

**Option C: No new work discovered**
- **Action:** Document "No scope creep identified"
- **Next:** Proceed to Phase 5

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 4 Examples for new work discovery examples

**Update Agent Status:**
```markdown
**Progress:** Phase 4 - COMPLETE (scope validated, no split needed)
**Next Action:** Phase 5 - Cross-Feature Alignment
**Blockers:** None
```

---

## Phase 5: Cross-Feature Alignment

**Goal:** Compare this feature's spec to all completed features, resolve conflicts

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This prevents features from having incompatible assumptions or duplicate work.

**Skip if:** This is the FIRST feature in the epic (no other features to compare to)

---

### Step 5.1: Identify Completed Features

**Check epic EPIC_README.md Feature Tracking table:**

Look for features with "S2 Complete" marked [x]

**Document:**
```markdown
**Features to Compare:**
- Feature {M}: {Name} (completed S2)

**Current Feature:**
- Feature {N}: {Name}
```

**If this is the first feature:**
```markdown
**Features to Compare:** None (this is first feature)

**Action:** Skip Phase 5 (Cross-Feature Alignment)
**Next:** Phase 6 (Acceptance Criteria & User Approval)
```

---

### Step 5.2: Compare Specs Systematically

**For EACH completed feature, perform pairwise comparison:**

**Read completed feature's spec.md:**
- Use Read tool to load entire spec
- Focus on: Components Affected, Data Structures, Requirements, Algorithms

**Create comparison document:**

`epic/research/ALIGNMENT_{current_feature}_vs_{other_feature}.md`

**Use template from:** `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 5 Examples → Complete Feature Comparison

**Comparison categories:**
1. Components Affected (overlapping files/modules)
2. Data Structures (overlapping data formats)
3. Requirements (duplicate work)
4. Assumptions (incompatible assumptions)
5. Integration Points (dependencies)

---

### Step 5.2.5: Send Messages for Issues in Other Features (NEW)

If you find issues in another feature's spec during comparison:

**DO NOT update other feature's files directly**

Instead, send message via agent_comms:

**File:** `agent_comms/{your_id}_to_{owner_id}.md`

**Template:**
```markdown
## Message: Cross-Feature Alignment Issue
**From:** {your_id} (Feature {N})
**To:** {owner_id} (Feature {M})
**Subject:** {Brief description}
**Status:** ⏳ UNREAD

**Issue:** {Detailed description with line numbers from Feature M spec}

**Suggested Action:** {What owner should do to resolve}

**Urgency:** {LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH}

**Context:** Found during S2.P3 Phase 5 (Cross-Feature Alignment) for Feature {N}
```

**The other agent will:**
- Review during next coordination heartbeat (15 min)
- Evaluate suggestion
- Update their spec if agreed OR send counter-proposal
- Send acknowledgment message
- Mark your message as ✅ READ

**Primary agent monitors:**
- All agent-to-agent messages during coordination
- Resolves disputes if agents can't align
- Escalates to user if necessary

**Benefits:**
- Issues fixed immediately (not deferred to S3)
- Distributed validation (multiple agents review each feature)
- Agents maintain ownership of their features
- Reduces Primary's S3 workload

---

### Step 5.3: Resolve Conflicts

**For EACH conflict found:**

**Option A: Update current feature (Feature N)**
- Modify spec.md to align with completed feature
- Update checklist.md if new questions arise
- Document change with reason

**Option B: Update completed feature (Feature M)**
- **CAUTION:** Completed feature may already be in implementation
- Check if other feature is in S5 (implementation)
- If yes, coordinate changes with implementation
- If no (only S2 complete), update its spec

**Option C: Create shared utility**
- If both features need same functionality
- Create new Feature X: Shared Utility
- Both features depend on Feature X
- Return to S1 to create new feature

**Document resolution in both specs**

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 5 Examples → Alignment with Conflicts Found

---

### Step 5.4: Get User Confirmation on Conflicts (If Any)

**If CRITICAL conflicts found, present to user using format from:**
`reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 5 Examples

**If user approves resolution:**
- Update spec.md and checklist.md
- Document approval in alignment report
- Update completed feature if needed
- Continue to Step 5.5

**If NO conflicts found:**
- Document "Zero conflicts with Feature {M}"
- No user confirmation needed
- Continue to Step 5.5

---

### Step 5.5: Document Alignment Verification

**Create summary in current feature's spec.md:**

```markdown
## Cross-Feature Alignment

**Compared To:**
- Feature {M}: {Name} (S2 Complete) - {Date}

**Alignment Status:** ✅ No conflicts / ⚠️ Conflicts resolved

**Details:**
{Brief summary of comparison}

**Changes Made:**
{Any changes to this spec based on alignment}

**Verified By:** Agent
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

**Update Agent Status:**
```markdown
**Progress:** Phase 5 - COMPLETE (aligned with {N} features, {M} conflicts resolved)
**Next Action:** Phase 6 - Acceptance Criteria & User Approval
**Blockers:** None
```

---

## Phase 6: Acceptance Criteria & User Approval

**Goal:** Create user-facing summary of what this feature will do, get explicit approval

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This is a MANDATORY gate. Cannot proceed to S3 without user approval.

**Why this matters:**
- User needs to understand EXACTLY what will be implemented
- This is the last chance to adjust before implementation planning
- User approval locks the spec (changes after this require returning to S2)

**When user requests investigation (e.g., "check compatibility"), use systematic framework:**

**Comprehensive Investigation Checklist:**

**When user requests investigation, cover ALL 5 categories:**
1. **Method/Function Calls:** Where X calls new code, parameter passing, defaults
2. **Configuration/Data Loading:** ConfigManager creation, config key loading, missing keys
3. **Integration Points:** Flow effects, affected files
4. **Timing/Dependencies:** Transition issues, sequencing
5. **Edge Cases:** Old config + new code, new config + old code

**After investigation:**
- Mark status: PENDING USER APPROVAL
- Present findings covering ALL 5 categories
- Wait for explicit approval
- ONLY THEN mark RESOLVED

---

---

### Step 6.1: Create Acceptance Criteria Section

**Add to spec.md (near the end, before any appendices):**

**Use template from:** `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 6 Examples → Complete Acceptance Criteria

**Required sections:**
1. **Behavior Changes** (new functionality, modified functionality, no changes)
2. **Files Modified** (new files, existing files modified, data files)
3. **Data Structures** (new structures, modified structures)
4. **API/Interface Changes** (new methods, modified methods, no changes)
5. **Testing** (test counts, coverage targets, edge cases)
6. **Dependencies** (depends on, blocks, external dependencies)
7. **Edge Cases & Error Handling** (edge cases handled, error conditions)
8. **Documentation** (user-facing, developer documentation)
9. **User Approval** (checkbox, timestamp placeholder, notes)

---

### Step 6.2: Present to User for Approval

### Step 6.2: Present to User for Approval

**Message to user:**

```markdown
## Feature {N} ({Name}) - Ready for Approval

I've completed S2 deep dive for Feature {N}:

**Spec Status:** {N} questions resolved, alignment complete, scope validated

**What This Feature Will Do:** {2-3 sentence summary}

**Impact:**
- Files: {count} new, {count} modified
- API changes: {summary}
- Dependencies: {summary}

**Review Acceptance Criteria:**
`.shamt/epics/SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/feature_{N}_{name}/spec.md`

Acceptance Criteria includes: behavior changes, files modified, data structures, API changes, testing, edge cases.

**Do you approve these acceptance criteria?**

If yes: I'll mark approval and proceed to next feature/S3
If changes needed: Let me know what to modify
```text

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 6 Examples

---

**Examples:** See `reference/stage_2/refinement_examples.md` → Phase 6 Examples → User Approval Process

---

### Step 6.3: WAIT for User Approval

⚠️ **STOP - Do NOT proceed without explicit user approval**

**DO NOT:** Mark complete, proceed to next feature/S3, or assume approval if silent
**DO:** Wait for explicit approval, answer questions, make modifications if requested

**Update Agent Status:** Waiting for user approval

---

### Step 6.4: Handle User Response

**If APPROVES:** Update spec.md with approval checkbox, timestamp, notes → Continue to Step 6.5

**If REQUESTS CHANGES:**
1. Document changes, update spec.md and checklist.md
2. Re-present updated criteria
3. Wait for approval (return to Step 6.3)

**If REJECTS (major changes):**
1. Determine return phase: Phase 0 (misunderstanding), Phase 1 (research gap), Phase 2 (wrong requirements), Phase 3 (wrong answers)
2. Return to appropriate phase and restart

---

### Step 6.5: Mark Feature Complete (After Approval)

**Update feature README.md:**
- Mark all S2 phases complete
- Set S2 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- Update Agent Status: S2 complete, ready for next feature/S3
- Update completion date


**Next Steps:**

{IF more features remain:}
- Begin S2 for next feature: Feature {N+1} ({Name})
- Repeat deep dive process

{IF all features complete S2:}
- Transition to S3 (Cross-Feature Sanity Check)
- Systematic comparison of all feature specs
- Get user sign-off on complete plan

**Ready to proceed?**
```

---
