## Overview

**What is this guide?**
Specification Validation Phase is a critical quality gate where you assume everything in the spec and checklist is wrong, inaccurate, or incomplete, then conduct deep research to validate every claim and self-resolve as many checklist questions as possible before user interaction.

**When do you use this guide?**
- S2.P2 complete (Phase 2.5 Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check PASSED)
- spec.md has requirements with traceability
- checklist.md has open questions
- Ready to validate and improve specification quality

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ All spec claims validated with additional evidence
- ✅ Checklist questions self-resolved where possible (research-based answers)
- ✅ New checklist questions identified through deeper investigation
- ✅ Multi-approach questions flagged for user decision
- ✅ Specification quality significantly improved before user interaction

**Time Estimate:**
30-45 minutes (1 phase with 4 steps)

**Exit Condition:**
Validation Phase is complete when all spec claims are validated, maximum checklist questions are self-resolved through research, and only genuine unknowns or multi-approach decisions remain for user input.

## Critical Rules

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - These MUST be copied to README Agent Status │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ ASSUME EVERYTHING IS WRONG (validation mindset)
   - Treat spec.md as hypotheses to validate (not facts)
   - Treat checklist.md as assumptions to research (not final questions)
   - Question every claim, requirement, and implementation detail
   - Validate with additional evidence from codebase

2. ⚠️ DEEP RESEARCH VALIDATION (beyond Phase 1 research)
   - Go deeper than initial research (read more files, check patterns)
   - Look for counter-evidence that contradicts spec claims
   - Find actual examples of similar implementations
   - Verify field mappings, data types, naming conventions

3. ⚠️ SELF-RESOLVE CHECKLIST QUESTIONS (reduce user burden)
   - Research answers to checklist questions where possible
   - Only leave questions that require user preference/decision
   - Convert research findings into spec requirements with sources
   - Mark resolved questions [x] with research evidence

4. ⚠️ IDENTIFY NEW QUESTIONS (comprehensive discovery)
   - Look for missing edge cases through deeper investigation
   - Find additional implementation decisions not yet considered
   - Discover integration points or dependencies missed in initial research
   - Add new questions to checklist based on validation findings

5. ⚠️ FLAG MULTI-APPROACH QUESTIONS (user decision required)
   - If multiple valid approaches exist, leave as user question
   - Document all viable options with pros/cons
   - Don't make arbitrary choices between valid alternatives
   - Let user decide on architectural/design preferences

6. ⚠️ UPDATE SPEC IMMEDIATELY (real-time validation)
   - Add new requirements based on validation findings
   - Update existing requirements with additional evidence
   - Remove or modify incorrect claims discovered during validation
   - Maintain requirement traceability (Source: Validation Research)
```

### Critical Decisions Summary

**Validation Phase has 1 major decision point per checklist question:**

### Decision Point: Can This Question Be Self-Resolved?
**Question:** Can this checklist question be answered through additional research?
- **Single clear answer found:** Self-resolve, add to spec as requirement, mark [x] in checklist
- **Multiple valid approaches found:** Flag for user decision, document all options
- **No research-based answer possible:** Leave as user question (preference/business decision)
- **Impact:** Reduces user burden by answering researchable questions, improves spec quality

### Phase 2.75: Specification Validation

**Goal:** Validate all spec claims and self-resolve maximum checklist questions through deep research

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Assume everything in spec and checklist is wrong until proven right with evidence.

---

### Step 2.75.1: Validate All Spec Claims

**Validation mindset:** Every requirement in spec.md is a hypothesis to validate.

**For EACH requirement in spec.md:**

```markdown
## Spec Validation Audit

### Requirement 1: {Name}

**Original Claim:** {What spec currently says}

**Validation Research:**
- Additional files checked: {List files read for validation}
- Evidence found: {Specific evidence supporting or contradicting claim}
- Counter-evidence: {Any evidence that contradicts the claim}

**Validation Result:**
- ✅ CONFIRMED: Claim is accurate (evidence: {cite specific evidence})
- ⚠️ MODIFIED: Claim needs adjustment (change: {what to modify})
- ❌ INCORRECT: Claim is wrong (correction: {what's actually true})

**Action Taken:**
- {No change needed / Updated spec.md / Added new requirement}
```

**Example validation research:**

```markdown
### Requirement 2: Create CrewMemberS3VO with Essential Fields

**Original Claim:** "Include nested objects: crewMemberSchedulePeriod, qualifications, historicalAssignments"

**Validation Research:**
- Additional files checked: 
  - CrewMemberSchedulePeriodBatchResponseVO.java (read full structure)
  - CrewQualificationBatchResponseVO.java (read field definitions)
  - Searched for "historicalAssignments" usage patterns
- Evidence found: 
  - CrewMemberSchedulePeriodBatchResponseVO has 29 fields (not just basic fields)
  - QualificationBatchResponseVO has aircraftType, qualified, expirationDate fields
  - historicalAssignments is List<Long> in current code, but S3 schema shows full objects
- Counter-evidence: 
  - S3 schema shows historicalAssignments as full assignment objects, not just IDs

**Validation Result:**
- ⚠️ MODIFIED: Need to clarify historicalAssignments structure (full objects vs IDs)

**Action Taken:**
- Added Question 5 to checklist about historicalAssignments structure
- Updated requirement to note discrepancy between current code and S3 schema
```

**Research deeper than Phase 1:**
- Read complete file contents (not just searched patterns)
- Check multiple similar classes for consistency
- Look for existing conversion examples
- Verify data type mappings
- Check naming convention patterns

---

### Step 2.75.2: Self-Resolve Checklist Questions

**For EACH question in checklist.md:**

**Research approach:**
1. **Can this be answered by reading more code?** → Research and resolve
2. **Are there existing patterns to follow?** → Research and resolve
3. **Is this a user preference/business decision?** → Leave for user
4. **Are there multiple valid approaches?** → Document options, leave for user

**Self-resolution process:**

```markdown
## Checklist Question Research

### Question 1: {Title}

**Research Conducted:**
- Files examined: {List additional files read}
- Patterns found: {Existing patterns in codebase}
- Similar implementations: {Examples of similar code}

**Research Findings:**
- {Finding 1 with evidence}
- {Finding 2 with evidence}
- {Finding 3 with evidence}

**Resolution Decision:**
- ✅ SELF-RESOLVED: Clear answer found through research
- ⚠️ MULTI-APPROACH: Multiple valid options found (user decision needed)
- ❓ USER-PREFERENCE: Business/design decision (user input required)

**If SELF-RESOLVED:**
- Answer: {Research-based answer}
- Evidence: {Cite specific code/patterns found}
- Action: Mark [x] in checklist, add requirement to spec

**If MULTI-APPROACH or USER-PREFERENCE:**
- Options documented: {List all viable approaches}
- Recommendation updated: {Best option based on research}
- Leave for user decision in S2.P3
```

**Example self-resolution:**

```markdown
### Question 1: Date Field Format in S3 Schema

**Research Conducted:**
- Files examined: 
  - AssignmentBatchResponseVO.java (current date field types)
  - Jackson configuration in application.yml
  - Existing JSON serialization examples
- Patterns found: 
  - Current VOs use String for dateTime fields (beginDateTime, endDateTime)
  - Jackson auto-converts Calendar to ISO 8601 strings
  - No custom date serializers configured

**Research Findings:**
- AssignmentBatchResponseVO already uses String for beginDateTime/endDateTime
- S3 schema matches existing pattern (ISO 8601 strings)
- No conversion needed - direct field mapping

**Resolution Decision:**
- ✅ SELF-RESOLVED: Use String fields (matches existing pattern)

**Answer:** Use String fields for all date/time values (ISO 8601 format)
**Evidence:** AssignmentBatchResponseVO.java lines 15-16 show String beginDateTime/endDateTime
**Action:** Mark [x] in checklist, add requirement to spec
```

### Step 2.75.3: Identify New Questions Through Deep Investigation

**Deep investigation areas:**

**1. Integration Points:**
- How does this feature integrate with existing systems?
- Are there dependency injection requirements?
- What about transaction boundaries?

**2. Error Handling:**
- What happens when conversion fails?
- How are null/missing values handled?
- Are there validation requirements?

**3. Performance Considerations:**
- Are there memory implications for large datasets?
- Should conversion be streamed or batched?
- Are there caching considerations?

**4. Testing Requirements:**
- What test data is needed?
- Are there existing test utilities to leverage?
- What edge cases need coverage?

**5. Configuration:**
- Are there configurable parameters?
- Environment-specific behavior?
- Feature flags or toggles?

**Research process:**
```bash
## Look for similar conversion methods
grep -r "convertTo.*Response" --include="*.java"

## Check error handling patterns
grep -r "try.*catch" service/ota-info-service-application/src/main/java/com/swacorp/crew/sched/ota/info/application/service/

## Look for validation patterns
grep -r "@Valid\|@NotNull\|@NotEmpty" --include="*.java"

## Check configuration patterns
find . -name "application*.yml" -o -name "*.properties"
```

**Add new questions to checklist:**
```markdown
### Question 5: {New Question} (NEW - from validation research)
- [ ] **OPEN**

**Context:** During validation, discovered {what was found}

**Research Evidence:** {What research revealed this question}

**Options:**
A. {Option based on research}
B. {Alternative option}
C. {Third option if applicable}

**Recommendation:** {Best option based on research findings}

**Why this is a question:** {Why user input is needed despite research}
```

---

### Step 2.75.4: Update Spec with Validation Findings

**Add new requirements based on validation:**

```markdown
### Requirement 8: {New Requirement from Validation}

**Description:** {What this requirement specifies}

**Source:** Validation Research (Phase 2.75)
**Traceability:** Discovered during spec validation through {research method}

**Implementation:**
- {Implementation details based on research}
- {Evidence from codebase}

**Technical Details:**
- {Specific technical requirements}
- {Integration points discovered}
- {Error handling requirements}

**Evidence:**
- File: {specific file and line numbers}
- Pattern: {existing pattern found}
- Similar implementation: {reference to similar code}
```

**Update existing requirements with additional evidence:**

```markdown
### Requirement 2: Create CrewMemberS3VO with Essential Fields (UPDATED)

**Description:** {Original description}

**Source:** Epic notes Step 2, Task 2 + Validation Research
**Traceability:** Direct user request + additional validation evidence

**Implementation:**
- {Original implementation}
- **Validation Update:** {Additional details from validation research}

**Additional Evidence (from validation):**
- CrewMemberSchedulePeriodBatchResponseVO has 29 fields (full structure documented)
- QualificationBatchResponseVO structure verified (aircraftType, qualified, expirationDate)
- Historical assignments mapping clarified through S3 schema comparison
```

**Mark resolved checklist questions:**

```markdown
### Question 1: Date Field Format in S3 Schema
- [x] **RESOLVED:** Use String fields (matches existing pattern)

**Research Answer:**
AssignmentBatchResponseVO already uses String for beginDateTime/endDateTime fields. S3 schema matches this existing pattern. No conversion needed - direct field mapping.

**Evidence:**
- File: AssignmentBatchResponseVO.java lines 15-16
- Pattern: String beginDateTime, String endDateTime
- Consistency: S3 schema uses same format

**Implementation Impact:**
- Use String fields for all date/time values in S3 VOs
- Direct field mapping from existing VOs (no conversion logic needed)
- Follow ISO 8601 format as shown in S3 schema examples
```
