# S2.P1: Spec Creation and Refinement (3 Iterations)

🚨 **MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL**

**Before starting this phase — including when resuming a prior session:**
1. **Quick entry point:** `reference/stage_2/stage_2_reference_card.md` — covers S2.P1 and S2.P2 happy path; use for second or later features
2. **Full guide (this file):** Read entirely for your first time using this stage or when encountering edge cases
3. Verify prerequisites (S1 complete, feature folder exists)
4. Update feature README.md Agent Status with guide name + timestamp

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Skip I2 (Checklist Resolution) without passing the I1 Completeness Gate — I2 may only be skipped if Gate 1.5 passes (see Gate 1.5 below). If the gate fails or was not run, I2 is mandatory
- Skip I3 (Refinement & Alignment) — it is always mandatory; it embeds Gate 2 and Gate 3 which cannot be bypassed
- Complete I3 without running the Validation Loop because "the spec looks complete" — primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation is required before proceeding to Gate 3 (User Approval)

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

## Prerequisites

**Before starting S2.P1:**

- [ ] S1 complete (Epic Planning and Discovery Phase)
- [ ] DISCOVERY.md exists and is user-approved
- [ ] Feature folder created with initial files (README.md, spec.md with Discovery Context, checklist.md, lessons_learned.md)
- [ ] spec.md has Discovery Context section populated
- [ ] Read validation_loop_spec_refinement.md to understand validation requirements
- [ ] Working directory: Feature folder

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- Return to S1 to complete missing items
- Do NOT start S2.P1 until prerequisites met

---

## Overview

**Purpose:** Research feature, create spec.md and checklist.md, get user approval (Gate 3)

**Structure:** 3 iterations (I2 is skippable if Gate 1.5 passes)
- S2.P1.I1: Feature-Level Discovery (60-90 min) - Embeds Gate 1, followed by Gate 1.5
- S2.P1.I2: Checklist Resolution (45-90 min) - Skippable if Gate 1.5 passes
- S2.P1.I3: Refinement & Alignment (30-60 min) - Embeds Gate 2, includes Gate 3 (always mandatory)

**Time:** 2.25-4 hours per feature
**Prerequisites:** S1 complete, DISCOVERY.md exists, feature folder created

**Model Selection for Token Optimization (SHAMT-27):**

Spec refinement can save 25-35% tokens through delegation:

```
Primary Agent (Opus):
├─ Spawn Haiku → File tree exploration (glob), keyword searches (grep)
├─ Spawn Sonnet → Read implementation code, identify patterns
├─ Primary handles → Write spec.md, make design decisions, validation loop primary rounds
├─ Spawn Haiku (2x in parallel) → Sub-agent confirmations
└─ Primary writes → Final spec.md updates, checklist resolution
```

**See:** `reference/model_selection.md` for Task tool examples.

## S2.P1.I1: Feature-Level Discovery (60-90 min)

### Purpose
Research feature, draft spec.md and checklist.md, validate with Validation Loop (embeds Gate 1)

### Steps

**1. Read Discovery Context (5-10 min)**
- Read `DISCOVERY.md` from S1.P3
- Identify feature-specific sections
- Note integration points

**2. Reference Previously Completed Features (5-10 min)**
- Read spec.md files from ALL previously completed features
- Check alignment opportunities (naming, patterns, approaches)
- Identify potential conflicts early
- Document alignment decisions

**3. Targeted Research (20-30 min)**
- Search for related code (Glob, Grep)
- **USE READ TOOL** to read existing implementations
- **Verify External Library Compatibility** (if feature uses external APIs/libraries):
  - Test libraries with mock data BEFORE writing spec
  - Check: endpoint override support, mock compatibility, test environment compatibility
  - Document compatibility or workarounds needed
  - Time investment: 15-20 min per library (saves 2+ hours debugging later)
- **Extensibility & Ownership Questions** (if feature integrates with external services, selectable options, or configurable backends):
  - **Who controls this choice?** End user (UI dropdown), admin (dashboard config), or ops (env var / deploy-time config)?
  - **Will users see implementation details?** (e.g., provider name, model ID) or is it abstracted?
  - **Will we swap providers in the future?** If yes → design for extensibility (provider pattern, dependency injection)
  - **Runtime switchable or deploy-time config?** (env var reload vs code change)
  - Add these as checklist questions if answers are unclear — do NOT assume user-facing
  - **Historical context:** a child project's Feature 01 implemented a user-facing model dropdown when the requirement was actually config-driven provider selection, requiring a full Feature 02 refactor
- Document findings in research notes

**4. Draft Spec & Checklist (20-30 min)**
- Create `feature_XX_name/spec.md` (initial draft with Discovery Context)
- Create `feature_XX_name/checklist.md` (QUESTIONS ONLY - agents NEVER mark [x])
- Include requirement traceability (link to epic requirements)

**5. Document Research Findings (5-10 min)** - **MANDATORY**
- Create `feature_XX_name/RESEARCH_NOTES.md` (REQUIRED for all features)
- Include: code locations found, integration points, compatibility findings, open questions
- **Optional exception:** Features with <3 requirements AND no external dependencies may skip
- When in doubt, create research notes (better to have than not)

**6. Validation Loop Validation (15-30 min)** - **EMBEDS GATE 1**

**Reference:** `reference/validation_loop_discovery.md`

- **Round 1:** Check spec completeness, checklist coverage
  - **Gate 1 Check (Research Completeness Audit):**
    - Category 1: Can cite EXACT files/classes to modify (with line numbers)?
    - Category 2: Have READ source code (actual method signatures)?
    - Category 3: Have verified data structures from source?
    - Category 4: Have reviewed DISCOVERY.md for context?
  - All 4 categories must pass with evidence
- **Round 2:** Fresh review with different patterns, find new issues
- **Round 3:** Final validation
- **Exit:** primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation (Gate 1 passed as part of validation)

**Outputs:**
- spec.md (draft, validated, Discovery Context included)
- checklist.md (QUESTIONS ONLY)
- RESEARCH_NOTES.md (REQUIRED, with rare exceptions documented above)

**Gates Embedded:**
- Gate 1: Research Completeness Audit (embedded in Validation Loop Round 1)

---

### Gate 1.5 — I1 Completeness Gate (15 min)

Run **after** the I1 Validation Loop exits. If ALL items below pass → skip I2 and proceed directly to I3. If ANY item fails → proceed normally to I2.

- [ ] All checklist.md questions have been resolved through research (zero questions remain "UNKNOWN", "TBD", or "check with user" in working notes — checklist.md itself remains questions-only per guide convention and is never marked [x])
- [ ] All acceptance criteria in spec.md are measurable (specific thresholds, not "should work" or "performs well")
- [ ] All referenced file paths verified with Read tool (no assumed paths remain)
- [ ] No circular dependencies with other features identified during I1
- [ ] No scope items flagged for discussion that haven't been resolved
- [ ] No cross-feature interface assumptions that haven't been verified against other features' I1 specs
  - *Note: in parallel S2, only features whose I1 is already complete can be checked. If the relevant feature's I1 is not yet complete, this criterion fails → proceed to I2.*

**If ALL items pass:** Note "I2 skipped (Gate 1.5 passed)" in spec.md Change Log. Proceed directly to I3.

**If ANY item fails:** Proceed to I2 normally.

**Important:** Gate 2 (Spec-to-Epic Alignment) and Gate 3 (User Approval) remain mandatory regardless of whether I2 was skipped. S2.P2 (Cross-Feature Alignment) also still runs after all I3s complete.

## S2.P1.I2: Checklist Resolution (45-90 min)

### Purpose
Present checklist to user, resolve questions one-at-a-time, update spec

### Steps

**1. Present Checklist to User (5 min)**
- Show checklist.md
- Explain: "These are questions I need answered to finalize the spec"
- Ask: "Ready to resolve these?"

**2. One-at-a-Time Resolution (30-60 min)**
- For each question in checklist:
  - Present question + context
  - Wait for user answer
  - **Use "Correct Status Progression" protocol** (see below)
  - Update spec.md immediately with answer
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT batch questions
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mark [x] autonomously

**3. Update Spec with Answers (10-20 min)**
- Incorporate all user answers into spec.md
- Maintain traceability (link questions to requirements)
- Update checklist.md status (ANSWERED, not [x] yet)

### "Correct Status Progression" Protocol (9 steps)

**This protocol prevents autonomous question resolution:**

1. User asks question (e.g., "check simulation compatibility")
2. Agent adds question to checklist → Status: OPEN
3. Agent investigates comprehensively (use 5-category checklist: method calls, config loading, integration points, timing/dependencies, edge cases)
4. Agent presents findings → Status: PENDING USER APPROVAL
5. User reviews findings, may ask follow-ups
6. Agent investigates follow-ups (if any)
7. User says "approved" or "looks good" (explicit approval required)
8. **ONLY THEN** agent marks → Status: RESOLVED
9. Agent adds requirement to spec with source: "User Answer to Question N"

**Key Principle:** Investigation complete ≠ Question resolved. Always wait for explicit user approval before marking RESOLVED.

**Example:**
```bash
❌ WRONG:
- Agent: "I checked simulations. Question 1 RESOLVED. Added Requirement 9."

✅ CORRECT:
- Agent: "I checked simulations. My findings: [details]. Status: PENDING. Do you approve?"
- User: "Yes, approved"
- Agent: "Question 1 marked RESOLVED. Adding Requirement 9 to spec."
```

**⚠️ "Port the Spec" Mode Warning:**
When S2 is framed as "porting an existing approved spec" (e.g., carrying forward a SHAMT-N spec to a successor epic), be extra vigilant about autonomous resolution. This framing creates a pull toward treating any new decision as "already covered." Watch for:
- Checklist items labeled "Verification Items" that expose genuinely NEW decisions during research
- Decisions where you have "strong evidence" from existing patterns — strong evidence → better PENDING presentation, NOT autonomous resolution
- Any design decision not explicitly decided in the source spec (even if you can rationalize it from the source)

**The rule remains unchanged:** Any new decision requires PENDING → User approval → RESOLVED. The "verification" framing does not change this protocol.

**Outputs:**
- spec.md (updated with user answers)
- checklist.md (all questions marked ANSWERED)

## S2.P1.I3: Refinement & Alignment (30-60 min)

### Purpose
Validate spec completeness, check per-feature alignment, get Gate 3 user approval

### Steps

**1. Per-Feature Alignment Check (10-15 min)**
- Read spec.md files from ALL previously completed features
- Compare against current feature's spec.md
- **Cross-Reference Checklist Questions** (for Group 2+ features):
  - If prior features answer question consistently → DELETE from checklist, document as "Aligned with Features X-Y"
  - If prior features answer inconsistently → Escalate to Primary (if parallel mode)
  - If prior features don't answer → KEEP question
- Check for: naming conflicts, approach conflicts, data structure conflicts
- Document any conflicts found
- Update current spec if needed

**1.5. Agent-to-Agent Issue Reporting (parallel mode only)**

**If working in parallel mode and issues found in OTHER features:**

Create message: `agent_comms/{YOUR_ID}_to_{PRIMARY_ID}.md`

Format:
```markdown
⏳ UNREAD

**From:** Secondary Agent {YOUR_ID}
**To:** Primary Agent {PRIMARY_ID}
**Date:** {timestamp}
**Type:** Cross-Feature Issue

## Issue Found

**Feature:** Feature {N} {name}
**Issue Type:** [Naming Conflict | Approach Conflict | Data Structure Conflict]
**Description:** [Detailed description]

**Affected Files:**
- feature_{M}_{your_feature}/spec.md (your feature)
- feature_{N}_{other_feature}/spec.md (other feature with issue)

**Recommended Resolution:** [Your suggestion]

**Priority:** [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]
```

Primary agent reviews during coordination heartbeat (every 15 minutes).

**If NOT in parallel mode:** Document issues in notes, fix in S2.P2

**2. Validation Loop Validation (15-30 min)** - **EMBEDS GATE 2**

**Reference:** `reference/validation_loop_spec_refinement.md`

🚨 **MANDATORY:** Create `{feature_folder}/VALIDATION_LOG.md` BEFORE starting Round 1. If this file does not exist, the validation loop has not started. Track `consecutive_clean` in the log (starts at 0, resets on any issue found, exit at 1 then trigger sub-agent confirmation).

- **Round 1:** Sequential read, requirement traceability check
  - **Gate 2 Check (Spec-to-Epic Alignment):**
    - Every requirement has source (Epic/User Answer/Derived)?
    - No scope creep (nothing user didn't ask for)?
    - No missing requirements (everything user asked for is included)?
    - All requirements trace to validated sources?
    - Zero assumptions in spec?
  - All criteria must pass
- **Round 2:** Read in reverse order, gap detection
- **Round 3:** Random requirement spot-checks, alignment with DISCOVERY.md
- **Exit:** primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation (Gate 2 passed as part of validation)

**3. If Gaps Found During Validation Loop - LOOP-BACK MECHANISM**
- Add new questions to checklist.md
- **LOOP BACK to S2.P1.I2** (Checklist Resolution)
- Resolve new questions with user
- **RESTART S2.P1.I3 from beginning** (fresh Validation Loop)
- Continue until Validation Loop passes with NO gaps

**4. Dynamic Scope Adjustment (5-10 min if needed)**
- Count checklist.md items
- If >35 items: Propose feature split to user
- Get user approval before proceeding

**4.5. Create Acceptance Criteria Section (5-10 min)** - **MANDATORY BEFORE GATE 3**
- Add "Acceptance Criteria" section to spec.md
- For each requirement, define measurable success criteria
- Define "Done" for each requirement
- Clear pass/fail conditions

**5. Gate 3: User Checklist Approval (5-10 min)** - **SEPARATE FROM VALIDATION LOOP**
- Present final spec.md to user (including Acceptance Criteria)
- Present final checklist.md (all ANSWERED)
- **Explicitly state:** "Please approve this spec.md (including the Acceptance Criteria section) and checklist.md"
- Ask: "Approve this feature specification?"
- **MANDATORY GATE:** Cannot proceed without approval
- Mark checklist items [x] ONLY AFTER user approves

**If User Requests Changes:**
- Update spec.md based on user feedback
- **LOOP BACK to S2.P1.I3 Step 2** (Validation Loop)
- Re-validate spec with fresh Validation Loop
- Re-present to user for approval
- Continue until user explicitly approves (no changes requested)

**If User Rejects Entire Approach:**
- User says: "This entire approach is wrong, start over"
- **STOP - Do not loop back to I3**
- Options:
  - (A) **Loop back to S2.P1.I1** (re-do research with different approach)
  - (B) **Escalate to S1** (re-do Discovery Phase if fundamental misunderstanding)
- Ask user: "Should I re-do research (S2.P1.I1) or return to Discovery Phase (S1.P3)?"
- Await user decision

**Outputs:**
- spec.md (final, user-approved, aligned with previous features, with acceptance criteria)
- checklist.md (final, user-approved, all marked [x])

**Exit Condition:**
- User explicitly approves spec (including acceptance criteria)
- Gate 3 passed

**Secondary Agent Behavior:**
```markdown
**If Secondary Agent:**
- Stop after S2.P1.I3 completes (Validation Loop passes + Gate 3 approved)
- Do NOT proceed to S2.P2 (only Primary runs S2.P2)
- Report to Primary: "S2.P1 complete for Feature XX"
- Update STATUS file: READY_FOR_SYNC = true
- Wait for Primary to run S2.P2 and S3
```

---

## Exit Criteria

**S2.P1 complete when ALL true:**

- [ ] I1 complete (spec drafted, research notes created, Gate 1 passed)
- [ ] I2 complete OR I2 skipped with Gate 1.5 passed (note in spec.md Change Log required if skipped)
- [ ] I3 complete (Gate 2 passed, Gate 3 passed)
- [ ] spec.md finalized and user-approved
- [ ] checklist.md all items marked [x] (after user approval)
- [ ] RESEARCH_NOTES.md exists
- [ ] Feature README.md updated with S2.P1_COMPLETE status

---

## Next Phase

**After S2.P1 complete:**

- **If Secondary Agent:** STOP, wait for Primary to run S2.P2
- **If Primary Agent:** Continue to S2.P2 after ALL features in group complete S2.P1
