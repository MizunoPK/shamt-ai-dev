# S2: Feature Planning Guide (ROUTER)

🚨 **IMPORTANT: This guide has been redesigned**

**This is a routing guide.** The complete S2 workflow is now split across two phases:

- **S2.P1 (Spec Creation and Refinement):** 3 iterations - Discovery, Checklist Resolution, Refinement (embeds Gates 1, 2, includes Gate 3)
- **S2.P2 (Cross-Feature Alignment):** Pairwise comparison (Primary agent only)

**📖 Read the appropriate phase guide based on your current phase.**

## 🔀 Parallel Work Check (FIRST PRIORITY)

**Before proceeding with S2 phases, check if you're in parallel work mode:**

### Are You a Secondary Agent?

**Check for handoff package:**
- If you received a handoff package (starts with "I'm joining as a secondary agent...")
- OR if your most recent message contains "My Agent ID: Secondary-A/B/C"
- **THEN:** You're a Secondary agent in parallel mode

**→ Go to:** `parallel_work/s2_secondary_agent_guide.md`
- Complete startup configuration
- Execute S2.P1 for your assigned feature (3 iterations)
- **STOP after S2.P1** - Do NOT proceed to S2.P2
- Wait for Primary to run S2.P2 and S3
- Follow coordination protocols (checkpoints, inbox, STATUS)
- **Do NOT continue with this router guide**

### Are You Primary Agent in Group-Based Parallel Mode?

**Check for group-based parallelization:**
- EPIC_README.md has "Feature Dependency Groups (S2 Only)" section
- Multiple dependency groups documented (Group 1, Group 2, etc.)
- User accepted group-based parallel work offering in S1
- Currently working on Group N features

**→ Go to:** `parallel_work/s2_primary_agent_group_wave_guide.md` (Group Wave Management)

**Group Wave Workflow:**
1. Complete S2 for Group 1 features first (solo work)
2. After Group 1 S2 complete → generate handoffs for Group 2
3. Coordinate Group 2 parallel work (secondary agents)
4. Repeat for additional groups if needed
5. After all groups complete S2 → run S2.P2 across ALL features
6. Proceed to S3 (groups no longer matter)

**Within each group:** Follow standard parallel coordination
**Use this router guide ONLY for phase navigation**

### Are You Primary Agent in Full Parallel Mode?

**Check for full parallelization (no groups):**
- All features independent (no spec-level dependencies)
- OR EPIC_README.md says "All features independent - Single S2 wave"
- User accepted parallel work offering in S1
- Generated handoffs for all features immediately

**→ Go to:** `parallel_work/s2_primary_agent_guide.md`
- Follow Primary workflow for parallel S2
- Work on Feature 01 using S2.P1 guide (3 iterations)
- Coordinate secondary agents (monitor, escalations, sync)
- After all features complete S2.P1 → run S2.P2 alone
- After S2 complete → run S3 and S4 alone
- **Use this router guide ONLY for phase navigation**

### Are You in Sequential Mode?

**Indicators:**
- No handoff package received
- User declined parallel work (or wasn't offered)
- Only you working on epic
- Working on features one at a time

**→ Continue below** with standard S2 workflow
- Use this router guide to navigate between phases
- Execute S2.P1 → S2.P2 for each feature (or feature group)

---

## 📖 Terminology Note

**S2 is split into two phases:**
- **S2.P1:** Spec Creation and Refinement (guide: `s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md`)
  - 3 iterations: I1 (Discovery), I2 (Checklist Resolution), I3 (Refinement & Alignment)
  - Embeds Gates 1 & 2, includes Gate 3 (User Checklist Approval)
- **S2.P2:** Cross-Feature Alignment (guide: `s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md`)
  - Pairwise comparison with Validation Loop
  - Primary agent only (secondary agents wait)

**Naming:** Uses hierarchical notation (S2.P1, S2.P2) with iterations (S2.P1.I1, S2.P1.I2, S2.P1.I3)

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting S2 for any feature:**

- [ ] S1 (Epic Planning) completed for this epic
- [ ] DISCOVERY.md created and user-approved
- [ ] Feature folder created with spec.md containing Discovery Context section
- [ ] checklist.md file exists (may be empty)
- [ ] Feature README.md has Agent Status section
- [ ] EPIC_README.md Feature Tracking table lists this feature

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- Return to S1 to complete missing items
- Do NOT proceed with S2 until all prerequisites met

---

## Quick Navigation

**Use this table to find the right guide:**

| Current Phase | Guide to Read | Time Estimate |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Starting S2 | `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` | 2.25-4 hours |
| S2.P1.I1: Feature-Level Discovery | `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` | 60-90 min |
| S2.P1.I2: Checklist Resolution | `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` | 45-90 min |
| S2.P1.I3: Refinement & Alignment | `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` | 30-60 min |
| S2.P2: Cross-Feature Alignment | `stages/s2/s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md` | 20-60 min |

## Overview

**What is S2?**
Feature Planning is where you research each feature, create detailed specifications with requirement traceability, resolve questions with user, validate alignment, and get user approval (Gate 3).

**Total Time Estimate:** 2.25-4 hours per feature (2 phases, 3 iterations in P1, 3 gates)

**Key Changes from Old S2:**
- **S2.P1 now has 3 iterations** (was 9 phases across 3 files)
- **Validation Loops embed Gates 1 & 2** (systematic validation)
- **S2.P2 is pairwise comparison** (moved from old S3)
- **Gate 3 explicit approval required** (including acceptance criteria)

**Exit Condition:** S2 is complete for a feature when spec has user-approved acceptance criteria (Gate 3 passed), Gates 1 & 2 passed via Validation Loops, and cross-feature alignment verified (S2.P2)

---

## Sub-Stage Breakdown

### S2.P1: Research Phase (Phases 0, 1, 1.5)

**Read:** `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Phase 0:** Discovery Context Review (review DISCOVERY.md, verify spec has context)
- **Step 1:** Targeted Research (research components mentioned in epic)
- **Phase 1.5:** Research Completeness Audit (MANDATORY GATE - verify research is thorough)

**Key Outputs:**
- "Discovery Context" section in spec.md (grounding in DISCOVERY.md findings)
- Research findings documented in epic/research/{FEATURE_NAME}_DISCOVERY.md
- Evidence collected: file paths, line numbers, code snippets
- Research completeness audit passed

**Time Estimate:** 45-60 minutes

**When complete:** Transition to S2.P2

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Reduces token usage by 60% (1,037 lines vs 2,348 lines)
- Focuses agent on research phase only
- Clear mandatory gate (Phase 1.5) before specification work

---

### S2.P2: Specification Phase (Phases 2, 2.5)

**Read:** `stages/s2/s2_p2_specification.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Step 2:** Update Spec & Checklist (document requirements with traceability)
- **Phase 2.5:** Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check (MANDATORY GATE - verify no scope creep)

**Key Outputs:**
- spec.md complete with requirement traceability (every requirement has source: Epic/User Answer/Derived)
- checklist.md with open questions (valid questions, not research gaps)
- Alignment check passed (no scope creep, no missing requirements)

**Time Estimate:** 30-45 minutes

**When complete:** Transition to S2.P3

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Focuses on specification quality and traceability
- Prevents scope creep through mandatory alignment check
- Ensures checklist questions are valid (not things that should have been researched)

---

### S2.P3: Refinement Phase (Phases 3, 4, 5, 6)

**Read:** `stages/s2/s2_p3_refinement.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Step 3:** Interactive Question Resolution (ONE question at a time)
- **Step 4:** Dynamic Scope Adjustment (split if >35 items)
- **Step 5:** Cross-Feature Alignment (compare to completed features)
- **Phase 6:** Acceptance Criteria & User Approval (MANDATORY GATE)

**Key Outputs:**
- All checklist questions resolved (zero open items)
- Spec updated in real-time after each answer
- Feature scope validated (split if needed)
- Cross-feature conflicts resolved
- Acceptance criteria created and user-approved

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours (depends on number of questions)

**When complete:** Feature's S2 is COMPLETE

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Focuses on interactive refinement with user
- Clear one-question-at-a-time protocol
- Systematic cross-feature alignment process
- User approval as final gate

## Mandatory Gates

**S2 has THREE mandatory gates that cannot be skipped:**

### Gate 1: Phase 1.5 - Research Completeness Audit (S2.P1)

**Purpose:** Verify research was thorough enough to avoid "should have known" checklist questions

**Pass Criteria:**
- Can cite EXACT files/classes that will be modified (with line numbers)
- Have READ source code (not just searched)
- Can cite actual method signatures from source
- Have searched for similar features and READ their implementation
- Have READ actual data files (not just assumed format)
- Have reviewed DISCOVERY.md in this phase

**If fail:**
- Return to Phase 1 (Targeted Research)
- Conduct additional research
- Collect missing evidence
- Re-run audit

**Cannot proceed to Phase 2 without passing this gate.**

---

### Gate 2: Phase 2.5 - Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check (S2.P2)

**Purpose:** Verify spec accurately reflects Discovery findings (no scope creep, no missing requirements)

**Pass Criteria:**
- Every requirement traces back to epic request OR user answer OR logical derivation
- No requirements with "assumption" as source
- No scope creep (adding things user didn't ask for)
- No missing requirements (user asked but not in spec)
- All requirements have cited sources

**If fail:**
- Remove scope creep items (move to checklist as questions)
- Add missing requirements from epic
- Fix requirement sources (Epic/User Answer/Derived)
- Re-run alignment check

**Cannot proceed to Phase 3 without passing this gate.**

---

### Gate 3: Phase 6 - User Approval (S2.P3)

**Purpose:** Get explicit user sign-off on acceptance criteria before implementation planning

**Pass Criteria:**
- Acceptance Criteria section created in spec.md
- User has reviewed acceptance criteria
- User explicitly approved (said "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- Approval checkbox marked [x]
- Approval timestamp documented

**If fail:**
- Update spec based on user feedback
- Re-present acceptance criteria
- Wait for approval again

**Cannot proceed to S3 without user approval.**

---

## Critical Rules (Same Across All Sub-Stages)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - Apply to ALL sub-stages                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ ALWAYS start with Phase 0 (Discovery Context Review)
   - Review DISCOVERY.md for epic-level findings
   - Verify spec has Discovery Context section

2. ⚠️ Research MUST be thorough BEFORE creating checklist
   - Phase 1.5 audit is MANDATORY GATE
   - Evidence required: file paths, line numbers, code snippets

3. ⚠️ NEVER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - CONFIRM WITH USER FIRST
   - Do NOT assume requirements or behavior
   - ASK USER via checklist.md questions
   - Spec assertions MUST be traced to sources

4. ⚠️ Every requirement MUST have traceability
   - Source: Epic Request (cite line)
   - Source: User Answer (cite question)
   - Source: Derived Requirement (explain derivation)
   - If source is "assumption" → add to checklist as question

5. ⚠️ ONE question at a time (don't batch questions)
   - Ask question
   - Wait for user answer
   - Update spec/checklist immediately
   - Then ask next question

6. ⚠️ Targeted research for THIS feature ONLY
   - Do NOT deep dive into other features yet
   - Keep research focused on current feature's scope

7. ⚠️ All research documents go in epic's research/ folder
   - NOT in feature folder
   - Shared across all features

8. ⚠️ If checklist grows >35 items, propose split
   - Too large to implement systematically
   - Get user approval before splitting
```

## How to Use This Router Guide

### If you're starting S2:

**READ:** `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md`

**Use the phase transition prompt** from `prompts_reference_v2.md`:
```markdown
I'm starting S2.P1 (Research Phase) for Feature {N}: {Name}.

I acknowledge:
- This guide covers Phases 0, 1, and 1.5 (Discovery Context → Research → Audit)
- I must review DISCOVERY.md (Phase 0) for epic-level context
- Phase 1.5 Research Audit is MANDATORY GATE (cannot proceed without passing)
- I must collect evidence: file paths, line numbers, code snippets
- Research must be targeted (THIS feature only, not entire epic)

Ready to begin Phase 0: Discovery Context Review.
```

---

### If you're resuming mid-S2:

**Check feature README.md Agent Status** to see current phase:

```markdown
**Current Phase:** DEEP_DIVE
**Current Step:** Phase {N} - {Description}
```

**Then read the appropriate guide:**
- **Phase 0, 1, or 1.5:** Read S2.P1
- **Phase 2 or 2.5:** Read S2.P2
- **Phase 3, 4, 5, or 6:** Read S2.P3

**Continue from "Next Action" in Agent Status.**

---

### If you're transitioning between sub-stages:

**After completing S2.P1:**
- Update feature README.md Agent Status: "Phase 1.5 complete, starting Phase 2"
- **READ:** `stages/s2/s2_p2_specification.md` (full guide)

  - ✅ Phase 2.5: Spec Alignment Check
  - ✅ Phase 6: User Approval

---

## Next Stage After S2

**If more features remain:**
- Begin S2 for next feature
- Start with S2.P1 (Research Phase)
- Repeat all phases

**If ALL features complete S2:**
- Transition to S3 (Cross-Feature Sanity Check)

📖 **READ:** `stages/s3/s3_epic_planning_approval.md`

---

## Why S2 Was Split

### Problems with Original Monolithic Guide (2,348 lines):

1. **Token inefficiency:** Agents loaded entire guide even when working on single phase
2. **Navigation difficulty:** Hard to find specific phase content in 2,348 line document
3. **Context dilution:** Important phase-specific rules buried in massive guide
4. **Checkpoint confusion:** Unclear when to re-read guide vs continue

### Benefits of Split Guides:

1. **60-70% token reduction per phase:**
   - S2.P1: 1,037 lines vs 2,348 lines (56% reduction)
   - S2.P2: ~700 lines vs 2,348 lines (70% reduction)
   - S2.P3: ~900 lines vs 2,348 lines (62% reduction)

2. **Clear phase boundaries:**
   - Natural breakpoints at mandatory gates
   - Each guide has focused critical rules
   - Obvious transition points

3. **Improved navigation:**
   - Agents read only relevant phase content
   - Faster guide comprehension
   - Easier to resume after session compaction

4. **Better mandatory reading protocol:**
   - Clear "read this guide" instruction per phase
   - Phase-specific acknowledgment prompts
   - Reduced guide abandonment

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to read all three sub-stage guides?**
A: Yes, but sequentially. Read S2.P1 first, complete it, then read S2.P2, complete it, then read S2.P3.

**Q: Can I skip a phase?**
A: No. All S2 phases are mandatory (S2.P1 with 3 iterations, S2.P2 alignment). The new structure doesn't change workflow requirements, just organization.

**Q: What if I'm resuming mid-stage?**
A: Check feature README.md Agent Status for current phase, then read the guide for that phase.

**Q: Do the mandatory gates change?**
A: No. Still 3 gates: Phase 1.5 (Research Audit), Phase 2.5 (Alignment Check), Phase 6 (User Approval).

**Q: Why isn't Phase 2.5 (Spec Validation) in S2.P2?**
A: It is! Phase 2.5 is "Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check" covered in S2.P2.

**Q: Can I reference the original guide?**
A: The original monolithic guide has been removed. Use the current split phase guides (S2.P1, S2.P2, S2.P3) for all S2 workflow work.

## Summary

**S2 is now split into three focused guides:**

1. **stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md** - Research & Audit (Phases 0, 1, 1.5)
2. **stages/s2/s2_p2_specification.md** - Specification & Alignment (Phases 2, 2.5)
3. **stages/s2/s2_p3_refinement.md** - Refinement & Approval (Phases 3, 4, 5, 6)

**Workflow remains the same:** 2 phases with 3 iterations in P1, 3 mandatory gates (Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3), same completion criteria

**Improvement:** 60-70% reduction in guide size per phase, clearer navigation, better phase focus

**Start here:** `stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md` (unless resuming mid-stage)
