🚨 **MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL**

**Before starting this guide — including when resuming a prior session:**
1. Use Read tool to load THIS ENTIRE GUIDE
2. Acknowledge critical requirements (see "Critical Rules" section below)
3. Verify prerequisites (see "Prerequisites Checklist" section below)
4. Update feature README.md Agent Status with guide name + timestamp

**DO NOT proceed without reading this guide.**

**After session compaction:**
- Check feature README.md Agent Status for current phase
- READ THIS GUIDE again (full guide, not summary)
- Continue from "Next Action" in Agent Status

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Start implementing feature code without completing Step 1 (Interface Verification Protocol) — interface verification is the MANDATORY FIRST STEP and prevents spec drift from incorrect interface assumptions
- Skip mini-QC checkpoints during Step 3 (Phase-by-Phase Implementation) to save time — mini-QC checkpoints catch integration issues before they compound across phases
- Commit code without completing Step 4 (Final Verification) — final verification confirms all spec requirements are met before proceeding to S7

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
S6 Implementation Execution is where feature code is implemented using the **architect-builder pattern** (SHAMT-30). The architect creates a mechanical implementation plan, validates it, and hands it off to a Haiku builder agent for execution.

**🚨 CRITICAL: Architect-Builder Pattern is MANDATORY for S1-S10 Epic Workflow**

S6 in the S1-S10 workflow now ALWAYS uses the architect-builder pattern:
- **Architect** (you, Sonnet/Opus): Creates mechanical implementation plan, validates it (9 dimensions), spawns builder
- **Builder** (Haiku sub-agent): Executes plan mechanically, reports completion or errors
- **Token Savings:** 60-70% reduction on implementation execution

**There is NO traditional implementation option in S6 for epic workflow.** The pattern is mandatory regardless of feature size or complexity.

**See:** `reference/architect_builder_pattern.md` for complete pattern documentation.

│             Architect-Builder Pattern (MANDATORY)             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

ARCHITECT RESPONSIBILITIES:

Step 1: Create Mechanical Implementation Plan
   ├─ Read S5 task-based implementation_plan.md
   ├─ Translate to mechanical steps (CREATE, EDIT, DELETE, MOVE)
   ├─ Use format from reference/implementation_plan_format.md
   └─ Save as implementation_plan.md (replaces S5 task-based plan)

Step 2: Validate Mechanical Plan (9 Dimensions)
   ├─ Create implementation_plan_validation_log.md
   ├─ Run 9-dimension validation loop
   ├─ Exit when: primary clean round + 2 Haiku sub-agents confirm zero issues
   └─ Update plan status to "Validated"

Step 3: Create Handoff Package
   ├─ Builder instructions
   ├─ Plan location
   ├─ Error handling protocol
   └─ Resume instructions (if applicable)

Step 4: Spawn Haiku Builder
   ├─ Use Task tool with model="haiku"
   ├─ Provide handoff package as prompt
   └─ Builder executes plan sequentially (Step 1, 2, 3...)

Step 5: Monitor Builder Execution
   ├─ Wait for builder completion or error report
   ├─ On success: proceed to Step 6
   └─ On error: diagnose, fix plan, resume from failed step

Step 6: Verify Implementation Complete
   ├─ Review builder's completion report
   ├─ Verify all steps executed successfully
   └─ Proceed to S7
```

**When do you use this guide?**
- S5 complete (task-based implementation_plan.md validated and user-approved at Gate 5)
- Ready to create mechanical implementation plan and hand off to builder

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ Mechanical implementation plan created and validated (9 dimensions)
- ✅ Builder successfully executed all implementation steps
- ✅ Feature code implemented per mechanical plan
- ✅ All verification checks passed
- ✅ Ready for S7 (Testing & Review)

**Time Estimate:**
- Architect planning & validation: 2-4 hours
- Builder execution: 20-40 minutes (Haiku, cost-optimized)
- Total: 2.5-4.5 hours (vs. 4-7 hours with traditional approach)

**Exit Condition:**
S6 is complete when builder reports successful execution of all steps in the mechanical implementation plan and architect has verified completion

---

## File Roles in S6

**Understanding which file serves which purpose:**

**implementation_plan.md = MECHANICAL EXECUTION PLAN**
- **What:** Step-by-step file operations plan created by architect in S6 Step 1
- **Contains:** Exact file operations (CREATE/EDIT/DELETE/MOVE), locate/replace strings, verification steps
- **Format:** Uses `reference/implementation_plan_format.md` specification
- **Validation:** 9-dimension validation loop before builder handoff
- **Created:** S6 Step 1 (architect translates from S5 task-based plan)
- **Used by:** Haiku builder agent (executes mechanically in S6 Step 4)

**implementation_plan_validation_log.md = PLAN VALIDATION TRACKER**
- **What:** Validation loop log for mechanical implementation plan
- **Contains:** Rounds, issues found, fixes applied, sub-agent confirmations
- **Created:** S6 Step 2 (during plan validation)
- **Exit criteria:** Primary clean round + 2 Haiku sub-agents confirm zero issues

**S5 task-based plan = ARCHIVED REFERENCE** (optional)
- **What:** High-level task-based plan from S5 (algorithms, data flow, testing strategy)
- **Location:** Can be moved to `implementation_plan_s5_tasks.md` after mechanical plan created (optional)
- **Use:** Reference for understanding high-level approach (not used by builder)

**spec.md = REQUIREMENTS REFERENCE**
- **What:** Feature requirements specification (created in S2, user-approved at Gate 3)
- **Use during S6:** Architect reads to create mechanical plan, verify completeness

**Key Principle (Architect-Builder):**
- **Architect** creates mechanical plan from S5 task-based plan and spec.md
- **Builder** executes mechanical plan without making design decisions
- **Separation** ensures planning (Sonnet/Opus) and execution (Haiku) are optimized for their roles

## Critical Rules

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - These MUST be copied to README Agent Status │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ Keep spec.md VISIBLE at all times during implementation
   - Not "consult when needed" - LITERALLY OPEN
   - Check every 5-10 minutes: "Did I consult specs recently?"

2. ⚠️ Interface Verification Protocol FIRST (before writing ANY code)
   - Verify ALL method signatures from source code
   - Copy-paste exact signatures (don't rely on memory)

3. ⚠️ Dual verification for EVERY requirement
   - BEFORE implementing: Read requirement in spec
   - AFTER implementing: Verify code matches spec

4. ⚠️ Test execution is conditional on the epic's Testing Approach (read EPIC_README)
   - Option A (smoke only): No test-after-step requirement. Mini-QC checkpoints are the quality gate.
   - Option B (integration scripts): Run integration script at PHASE completion (not after each step). Full pass required before proceeding to next phase.
   - Option C (unit tests only): Run unit tests after each step, 100% pass required.
   - Option D (both): Run unit tests after each step AND run integration script at phase boundaries.
   - Do NOT proceed with failing tests/scripts (regardless of option)

5. ⚠️ Mini-QC checkpoints after each major component
   - Not same as final QC - lightweight validation
   - Verify: Tests pass, spec requirements met, no regressions

6. ⚠️ Update implementation_checklist.md in REAL-TIME
   - Check off requirements AS YOU IMPLEMENT (not batched)
   - Prevents "forgot to implement requirement X"

7. ⚠️ NO coding from memory
   - Always consult actual spec text before coding
   - Memory degrades in minutes

8. ⚠️ Configuration Change Checkpoint (if modifying config)
   - Verify backward compatibility
   - Check ALL consumers of config
   - Document migration path

9. ⚠️ If ANY test fails → STOP, fix, re-run before proceeding

10. ⚠️ Create implementation_checklist.md FIRST
   - Must be created BEFORE writing ANY code
   - Track progress in real-time as you implement
   - Historical case: Agent skipped checklist creation, caught in Validation Round 1
```

## S6 Architect Workflow (Architect-Builder Pattern)

**🚨 THIS IS THE PRIMARY S6 WORKFLOW for S1-S10 epic work 🚨**

S6 implementation execution uses the architect-builder pattern. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Mechanical Implementation Plan

**Read complete documentation:** `reference/implementation_plan_format.md`

**Process:**
1. Read S5 task-based `implementation_plan.md` (high-level tasks, algorithms, data flow)
2. Read `spec.md` (requirements, edge cases, acceptance criteria)
3. Read `reference/implementation_plan_format.md` (mechanical plan specification)
4. Copy template: `templates/implementation_plan_template.md` → `implementation_plan.md`
5. Translate S5 tasks into mechanical steps:
   - **CREATE operations:** Full file content with all imports, exports, exact code
   - **EDIT operations:** Exact locate/replace strings (including whitespace, quotes, semicolons)
   - **DELETE operations:** File path to delete
   - **MOVE operations:** Source and destination paths
6. Every step must have **exact** details (no "add authentication", use "locate X, replace with Y")
7. Every step must have **mechanical verification** (read file, confirm text present)

**Example step format:**
```markdown
### Step 15: Add authentication middleware import
**File:** `src/server.ts`
**Operation:** EDIT
**Details:**
- Locate: `import { cors } from 'cors';`
- Replace with: `import { cors } from 'cors';\nimport { authenticate } from './middleware/auth';`
**Verification:** Read src/server.ts, confirm authenticate import present after cors import
```

**Output:** `implementation_plan.md` (mechanical format, replaces S5 task-based plan)

---

### Step 2: Validate Mechanical Plan (9 Dimensions)

**Read complete documentation:** `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md`, section on implementation plan validation

**Process:**
1. Create `implementation_plan_validation_log.md` (use template: `templates/implementation_plan_validation_log_template.md`)
2. Run validation rounds checking all 9 dimensions:
   - D1: Step Clarity - Every step unambiguous, no interpretation needed
   - D2: Mechanical Executability - Builder can execute without design decisions
   - D3: File Coverage Completeness - All files from spec covered
   - D4: Operation Specificity - EDIT steps have exact locate/replace, CREATE steps have full content
   - D5: Verification Completeness - Every step has mechanical verification method
   - D6: Error Handling Clarity - Success/failure criteria explicit
   - D7: Dependency Ordering - Steps in correct execution order
   - D8: Pre/Post Checklist Completeness - Checklists cover prerequisites and completion
   - D9: Spec Alignment - Plan implements ALL spec requirements
3. Fix issues found in each round
4. Exit when: primary clean round (≤1 LOW issue) + 2 Haiku sub-agents confirm zero issues
5. Update `implementation_plan.md` status to "Validated"

**Exit criteria:** `consecutive_clean = 1`, spawn 2 Haiku sub-agents in parallel, both confirm zero issues

**Output:** Validated `implementation_plan.md`, complete `implementation_plan_validation_log.md`

---

### Step 3: Create Handoff Package

**Read complete documentation:** `reference/architect_builder_pattern.md`, "Handoff Package Format" section

**Handoff package template:**
```markdown
You are a builder agent. Your role is to execute the implementation plan exactly as specified.

**Plan Location:** `{path/to/implementation_plan.md}`

**Your Responsibilities:**
1. Read the implementation plan file
2. Execute each step in sequential order (Step 1, 2, 3...)
3. Verify each step as specified
4. Report completion or halt on first error
5. DO NOT make design decisions or deviate from plan
6. DO NOT spawn sub-agents or parallelize work

**Error Handling Protocol:**
- If a step fails, STOP immediately - do not proceed to next step
- Report back to architect with:
  - Step number where error occurred
  - Exact error message received
  - Which verification failed (if applicable)
  - Current state (what was completed before error)
- Do NOT attempt retries, fixes, or workarounds
- Do NOT skip failed steps and continue
- Wait for architect instructions

**Start by reading the implementation plan, then execute it step by step.**
```

**Output:** Handoff package text (ready to provide to Task tool)

---

### Step 4: Spawn Haiku Builder

**Task tool invocation:**
```xml
<invoke name="Task">
  <parameter name="subagent_type">general-purpose</parameter>
  <parameter name="description">Execute implementation plan</parameter>
  <parameter name="model">haiku</parameter>
  <parameter name="prompt">{handoff package text from Step 3}</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**CRITICAL:** Use `model="haiku"` for token savings (60-70% reduction)

**Builder execution:**
- Builder reads `implementation_plan.md`
- Builder executes steps sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Builder verifies each step
- Builder reports completion OR halts on first error

---

### Step 5: Monitor Builder Execution

**Wait for builder completion or error report.**

**On Success:**
- Builder reports: "All steps completed successfully. Post-execution checklist complete."
- Proceed to Step 6

**On Error:**
- Builder STOPS immediately
- Builder reports:
  - Step number where error occurred (e.g., "Error at Step 23")
  - Exact error message
  - Verification status
  - Current state (Steps 1-22 completed, Step 23 failed)
- Architect diagnoses root cause (plan error, transient issue, environment issue)
- Architect takes action:
  - **Fix plan:** Update `implementation_plan.md`, spawn new builder from Step 23
  - **Retry:** Determine transient, instruct builder to retry Step 23
  - **Investigate:** Pause, investigate environment/codebase issue

**Error recovery protocol:** See `reference/architect_builder_pattern.md`, "Error Recovery Protocol" section

---

### Step 6: Verify Implementation Complete

**After builder reports success:**
1. Review builder's completion report
2. Verify all steps from `implementation_plan.md` were executed
3. Verify post-execution checklist items:
   - [ ] All steps completed without error
   - [ ] Verification checks passed
   - [ ] Tests run (if applicable)
   - [ ] Ready for handoff to S7
4. Update feature README.md Agent Status: "S6 complete, S7 ready"

**Proceed to S7 (Testing & Review)**

## Background: Traditional Implementation Details (Reference Only)

**Note:** The sections below describe traditional implementation mechanics. In S1-S10 epic workflow, you will NOT implement code directly - the Haiku builder executes the mechanical plan. These sections are preserved as reference material for understanding implementation details when creating mechanical plans.

**When to read these sections:**
- Creating mechanical plans (understand what the builder will do)
- Diagnosing builder errors (understand implementation mechanics)
- Background context for mechanical step creation

## Step 1: Interface Verification Protocol (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

**Purpose:** Verify ALL external interfaces BEFORE writing any code

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** "Never assume interface - always verify"

### Process:

1. **List all external dependencies from implementation_plan.md:**

From implementation_plan.md, extract all external methods/classes you'll call:

```markdown
External Dependencies to Verify:
1. ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier(rank: int)
2. csv_utils.read_csv_with_validation(filepath, required_columns)
3. DataRecord class (will add fields)
4. RecordManager.load_records() (will modify)
```

2. **For EACH dependency, READ actual source code:**

**DO NOT ASSUME - OPEN THE FILE AND READ IT**

```bash
## Example: Verify ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier
code -g "src/util/ConfigManager.py:234"
```

3. **Copy-paste EXACT signature:**

```python
## [module]/util/ConfigManager.py:234
def get_rank_multiplier(self, rank: int) -> Tuple[float, int]:
    """
    Calculate rank multiplier based on rank value.

    Args:
        rank (int): rank value (1-500)

    Returns:
        Tuple[float, int]: (multiplier, rating)
            multiplier: Score adjustment factor (0.8-1.2)
            rating: Confidence rating (0-100)
    """
    # ... implementation
    return (multiplier, rating)
```

4. **Document in interface contract table:**

Create `feature_{N}_{name}_interface_contracts.md`:

```markdown
## Feature {N}: {Name} - Verified Interface Contracts

**Purpose:** Document ALL external interfaces verified from source code

**Verification Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}

---

## Interface 1: ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier

**Source:** [module]/util/ConfigManager.py:234

**Signature:**
```
def get_rank_multiplier(self, rank: int) -> Tuple[float, int]
```markdown

**Parameters:**
- `rank` (int): rank value value
  - Valid range: 1-500
  - Type: int (NOT float, NOT str)

**Returns:**
- Tuple[float, int]
  - [0]: multiplier (float) - Score adjustment (0.8-1.2)
  - [1]: rating (int) - Confidence (0-100)

**Exceptions:**
- None documented (handles invalid input internally)

**Example Usage Found:**
```
## [module]/util/RecordManager.py:456
multiplier, rating = self.config.get_rank_multiplier(item_rank)
```markdown

**Verified:** ✅ Interface matches implementation_plan.md assumptions

---

## Interface 2: csv_utils.read_csv_with_validation

{Repeat for each interface}
```

5. **Verify assumptions match reality:**

Check implementation tasks:
- implementation_plan.md assumed: `get_rank_multiplier(rank: int) -> Tuple[float, int]`
- Actual interface: `get_rank_multiplier(self, rank: int) -> Tuple[float, int]`
- ✅ MATCH

**If mismatch found:**
- Update implementation_plan.md tasks to match reality
- Update spec.md if needed
- Document mismatch in interface contracts file

**Output:** Verified interface contracts document, confidence in interfaces

---

## Step 2: Create Implementation Checklist

**Purpose:** Track requirement completion during implementation

### Process:

1. **Extract all requirements from spec.md:**

Read spec.md sections:
- Objective
- Scope
- Components Affected
- Algorithms
- Edge Cases

2. **Create implementation_checklist.md:**

```markdown
## Feature {N}: {Name} - Implementation Checklist

**Purpose:** Track spec requirements during implementation (check off AS YOU IMPLEMENT)

**Instructions:**
- [ ] = Not implemented yet
- [x] = Implemented and verified

**Update this file IN REAL-TIME (not batched at end)**

---

## Requirements from spec.md

### Objective Requirements

- [ ] **REQ-1:** Load rank data from data/rankings/priority.csv
  - Implementation Task: Task 1
  - Implementation: RecordManager.load_rank_data()
  - Verified: {Check after implementing Task 1}

- [ ] **REQ-2:** Match items to rank values
  - Implementation Task: Task 2
  - Implementation: RecordManager._match_item_to_rank()
  - Verified: {Check after implementing Task 2}

---

### Algorithm Requirements

- [ ] **ALG-1:** Use default multiplier 1.0 if item not in rank data
  - Spec: Algorithms section, step 2c
  - Implementation Task: Task 2
  - Implementation: RecordManager._match_item_to_rank() returns None
  - Verified: {Check after implementing}

- [ ] **ALG-2:** Call ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier for matched items
  - Spec: Algorithms section, step 3
  - Implementation Task: Task 3
  - Implementation: RecordManager._calculate_rank_multiplier()
  - Verified: {Check after implementing}

---

### Edge Case Requirements

- [ ] **EDGE-1:** Handle rank file not found gracefully
  - Spec: Edge Cases section, case 3
  - Implementation Task: Task 11
  - Implementation: RecordManager.load_rank_data() try/except
  - Verified: {Check after implementing}

- [ ] **EDGE-2:** Handle invalid rank value (<1 or >500)
  - Spec: Edge Cases section, case 2
  - Implementation Task: Task 3
  - Implementation: RecordManager._calculate_rank_multiplier() validation
  - Verified: {Check after implementing}

---

{Continue for ALL requirements from spec.md}

---

## Summary

**Total Requirements:** {N}
**Implemented:** {Count of [x] items}
**Remaining:** {Count of [ ] items}

**Last Updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
```

**Output:** implementation_checklist.md created, ready for real-time updates

---

## Step 3: Phase-by-Phase Implementation

**Purpose:** Implement tasks from implementation_plan.md incrementally with continuous validation

### General Process (Repeat for EACH phase):

#### 3.1: Read Spec Requirements for This Phase

**Before implementing Phase N:**

1. **Open spec.md** (keep it VISIBLE throughout phase)
2. **Read requirements for this phase:**
   - From implementation_plan.md "Implementation Phasing" section
   - Example: Phase 1 = Core Data Loading (Tasks 1, 2)

3. **Read spec sections relevant to these tasks:**
   - Algorithms for these tasks
   - Edge cases for these tasks
   - Data structures for these tasks

#### 3.2: Implement Tasks (Keep Spec VISIBLE)

**Implementation Protocol:**

1. **For EACH task in phase:**

**BEFORE writing code:**
- Read spec requirement (exact text)
- Read implementation task acceptance criteria from implementation_plan.md
- Check interface contracts (verified signatures)

**WHILE writing code:**
- Keep spec.md VISIBLE (other window/split screen)
- Check spec every 5-10 minutes
- Question yourself: "Am I implementing what spec says?"

**AFTER writing code:**
- Re-read spec requirement
- Verify code matches spec EXACTLY
- Check implementation_checklist.md item

**⚠️ Special Case — Dependency Removal Tasks:** When a task removes an import or dependency (X):
1. Remove the import statement (obvious)
2. **ALSO remove ALL code that references X** — conditionals, comparisons, function calls (critical!)
3. Replacement code for X goes in the appropriate later phase/task
4. Phase checkpoint: `grep "X" {file}` to verify ALL references gone

> **Why this matters:** If only the import is removed but referencing code remains, the code fails at runtime with a `NameError` — not at import time. Phase checkpoints that only test `--help` or import will NOT catch this. The bug appears only when the affected code path runs.

2. **Example: Implementing Task 1 (Load Rank Data)**

**Read spec (Algorithms section):**
> "Load rank data from data/rankings/priority.csv"

**Read implementation_plan.md Task 1 acceptance criteria:**
```markdown
- [ ] Function load_rank_data() created in RecordManager
- [ ] Reads file from path: data/rankings/priority.csv
- [ ] Returns List[Tuple[str, str, int]]
- [ ] Handles FileNotFoundError gracefully
- [ ] Validates CSV has required columns: Name, Position, rank priority
- [ ] Logs number of rows loaded
```

**Implement:**

```python
## [module]/util/RecordManager.py

def load_rank_data(self) -> List[Tuple[str, str, int]]:
    """
    Load rank (external rank priority) data from CSV file.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, str, int]]: List of (Name, Position, rank priority) tuples

    Example:
        >>> rank_data = pm.load_rank_data()
        >>> rank_data[0]
        ('Christian McCaffrey', 'RB', 1)
    """
    filepath = self.data_folder / "rankings" / "priority.csv"

    try:
        # Read CSV with validation (from csv_utils)
        df = read_csv_with_validation(
            filepath,
            required_columns=['Name', 'Position', 'Rank'],
            encoding='utf-8'
        )

        # Convert to list of tuples
        rank_data = [
            (row['Name'], row['Position'], int(row['Rank']))
            for _, row in df.iterrows()
        ]

        # Log success
        self.logger.info(f"Loaded {len(rank_data)} rank values from {filepath}")

        return rank_data

    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Graceful degradation (spec.md Edge Cases, case 3)
        self.logger.error(f"rank file not found: {filepath}")
        return []  # Return empty list (not None, not crash)

    except Exception as e:
        # Unexpected error
        self.logger.error(f"Error loading rank data: {e}", exc_info=True)
        return []
```

**Verify against spec:**
- ✅ Loads from data/rankings/priority.csv (spec requirement)
- ✅ Returns List[Tuple[str, str, int]] (implementation_plan.md acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Handles FileNotFoundError (spec Edge Cases, case 3)
- ✅ Validates columns (implementation_plan.md acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Logs row count (implementation_plan.md acceptance criteria)

**Check off in implementation_checklist.md:**

```markdown
- [x] **REQ-1:** Load rank data from data/rankings/priority.csv
  - Implemented: RecordManager.load_rank_data()
  - Verified: 2025-12-30 15:45 (matches spec exactly)
```

3. **Continue for all tasks in phase**

#### 3.3: Test Execution for This Phase (Conditional on Testing Approach)

**Read Testing Approach from EPIC_README before executing.**

---

**If Option A (smoke only):**
- No test execution at this phase checkpoint
- Proceed directly to Mini-QC (Step 3.4)

---

**If Option C or D (unit tests included) — run after each step:**

1. **Run unit tests for this phase:**

```bash
## Run tests for Phase 1 (Data Loading)
python -m pytest tests/[module]/util/test_RecordManager_rank.py::test_load_rank_data_success -v
python -m pytest tests/[module]/util/test_RecordManager_rank.py::test_load_rank_data_file_not_found -v
```

2. **Verify 100% pass rate** — do NOT proceed to next phase with failures

3. **Document test results in feature README.md**

---

**If Option B or D (integration scripts included) — run at PHASE COMPLETION:**

1. **Run the feature's integration test script** (following `Integration Test Convention:` from EPIC_README):

```bash
## Example: pytest
pytest tests/integration/test_{feature_name}_integration.py -v

## Example: Python stdlib
python tests/integration/test_{feature_name}_e2e.py
```

2. **Early phases:** The script may fail on assertions that haven't been implemented yet — this is expected. Investigate failures: if a failure is due to incomplete implementation (intentional), note it. If a failure is unexpected (regression), fix it before continuing.

3. **Phase completion:** All assertions that *should* pass at this stage must pass. Full script pass required by end of final phase.

4. **If integration script doesn't exist yet:** Create the skeleton in Phase 1 (see Step 3.5 below). On first run, all assertions are expected to fail — this is normal.

---

**Document phase test/script results** in feature README.md Agent Status.

#### 3.4: Mini-QC Checkpoint

**Purpose:** Lightweight validation before next phase (not full QC)

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Tests executed per Testing Approach (Step 3.3) — all required tests/scripts pass
- [ ] For Options B/D: integration script exists and has been run (failing assertions on early phases OK — document expected failures)
- [ ] Spec requirements for this phase checked off in implementation_checklist.md
- [ ] No regressions (existing tests still pass)
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (imports, naming, docstrings)
- [ ] No obvious bugs (smoke test the functionality)

**Quick smoke test:**

```python
## Quick manual verification
from [module].util.RecordManager import RecordManager
pm = RecordManager(data_folder="data/")
rank_data = pm.load_rank_data()
print(f"Loaded {len(rank_data)} rank values")
print(f"First entry: {rank_data[0]}")
## Expected: Loaded 200+ rankings, First entry valid tuple
```

**If mini-QC passes:**
- ✅ Proceed to next phase
- Document in Agent Status: "Phase 1 complete, mini-QC passed"

**If mini-QC fails:**
- ❌ Fix issues
- Re-run tests
- Re-run mini-QC
- Only proceed when passed

#### 3.5: Repeat for All Phases

**Continue process for Phase 2, 3, 4, etc.:**

Each phase:
- Read spec requirements
- Keep spec VISIBLE
- Implement tasks
- Update implementation_checklist.md
- Run phase tests per Testing Approach (Step 3.3)
- Mini-QC checkpoint
- Proceed to next phase

---

#### 3.5: Create Integration Test Script Skeleton (Options B/D — Phase 1 only)

**When:** First phase of S6, if Testing Approach is B or D.

**Purpose:** Scaffold the integration test script early so it grows alongside implementation.

**Process:**

1. Read `Integration Test Convention:` from EPIC_README for location, naming, and framework
2. Create the script file at the specified location with the specified naming convention
3. Scaffold with the assertion list from the S5 Test Scope Decision:
   - Feature execution test (will fail until implementation complete)
   - Output structure test (will fail until output files exist)
   - Output value test (will fail until values are populated)
   - Integration points test (will fail until cross-feature wiring exists)
4. All assertions initially fail/skip — this is expected
5. As implementation progresses across phases, fill in the assertion details
6. Full pass is required by end of the final phase (before S7)

**Placement:** Follow `Integration Test Convention:` in EPIC_README exactly. One script per feature.

**Reference:** `reference/integration_test_script_pattern.md` for structure and conventions.

## Special Protocols

### Configuration Change Checkpoint

**If modifying league_config.json or config.py:**

1. **Verify backward compatibility:**

```markdown
## Config Change Impact Analysis

**Config Key Added:** "rank_multiplier_ranges"

**Backward Compatibility:**
- If key missing in old config: Use default value (empty dict)
- Code handles missing key: Yes (get with default)
  ```
  rank_ranges = config.get("rank_multiplier_ranges", {})
  ```markdown

**Migration Path:**
- No migration needed (new feature, not changing existing)
- User can optionally add key for customization

**Consumers:**
- ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier() - only consumer
- Handles missing key gracefully

**Verification:**
- [x] Tested with old config (key missing) - works
- [x] Tested with new config (key present) - works
```

2. **Check ALL consumers of config:**

Search for all code that reads this config:

```bash
grep -r "rank_multiplier_ranges" --include="*.py"
```

Verify each consumer handles both old and new config.

### Interface Change Protocol

**If modifying existing class/method signatures:**

⚠️ **WARNING:** Interface changes can break existing code

1. **Identify all callers:**

```bash
## Find all callers of method you're modifying
grep -r "\.load_players()" --include="*.py"
```

2. **Verify change is backward compatible:**
   - Adding optional parameter? ✅ Safe
   - Changing parameter type? ❌ Breaking change
   - Changing return type? ❌ Breaking change

3. **If breaking change:**
   - Update ALL callers
   - Update ALL tests

### No Coding from Memory Protocol

**If you find yourself thinking:**
- "I remember what the spec said..."
- "This algorithm is obvious..."
- "I know what this interface returns..."

**STOP - Consult actual sources:**

1. **Re-read spec.md** (don't trust memory)
2. **Re-check interface contracts** (verify signatures)
3. **Re-read implementation task** (check acceptance criteria)

**Why:** Memory degrades in minutes. Historical evidence shows memory-based coding leads to spec violations.

---

## Step 4: Final Verification

**After ALL phases complete:**

### 4.1: Verify All Implementation Tasks Complete

Check implementation_plan.md:

```markdown
## Implementation Status

**Total Tasks:** 30
**Completed:** 30
**Remaining:** 0

✅ All tasks complete
```

### 4.2: Verify All Tests Passing

Run complete test suite for this feature:

```bash
## Run ALL tests for this feature
python -m pytest tests/[module]/util/test_RecordManager_rank.py -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_rank_integration.py -v
```

**Required:** 100% pass rate

```bash
========================= 25 passed in 2.15s =========================
```

### 4.3: Verify All Requirements Checked Off

Check implementation_checklist.md:

```markdown
## Summary

**Total Requirements:** 45
**Implemented:** 45
**Remaining:** 0

✅ All requirements implemented and verified
```

### 4.4: Code Comments Self-Check

Scan all code you have written or modified in this feature — including test files — for any inline comments, docstrings, or explanatory block comments. Remove all of them.

**Allowed to remain:**
- License/copyright headers
- Tool-required markers (`# type: ignore`, `# noqa`, `// eslint-disable-next-line`, etc.)
- Any overrides documented in CODING_STANDARDS.md

If you find comments: remove them now, re-run tests, then continue to Step 4.5.

---

### 4.5: Final Smoke Test

Run feature end-to-end:

```bash
python run_[module].py --mode draft
## Verify: Loads rank data, calculates scores, generates recommendations
```

**Expected:** No errors, feature works end-to-end

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ "If You're Thinking This, STOP" - Anti-Pattern Detection  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

❌ "I'll keep spec in mind while coding"
   ✅ STOP - Keep spec VISIBLE (literally open in another window)

❌ "I remember the algorithm from the spec"
   ✅ STOP - Re-read the actual spec text (memory degrades)

❌ "Tests are failing but I'll fix them later"
   ✅ STOP - Fix tests NOW before proceeding (100% pass required)

❌ "I'll update implementation_checklist.md when all coding is done"
   ✅ STOP - Update in REAL-TIME as you implement

❌ "ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier probably returns float"
   ✅ STOP - Verify from interface contracts (it returns Tuple[float, int])

❌ "I'll skip mini-QC, the tests passed"
   ✅ STOP - Mini-QC is MANDATORY after each step

❌ "Implementation looks good, I'll skip final smoke test"
   ✅ STOP - Final smoke test is MANDATORY (tests != E2E workflow)

❌ "One test is failing but the others pass, good enough"
   ✅ STOP - 100% pass rate REQUIRED (not 90%, not 99%)

❌ "I'll verify code matches spec during S7 (Testing & Review)"
   ✅ STOP - Verify NOW as you implement (dual verification)
```

## Prerequisites for S7 (Testing & Review)

**Before transitioning to S7 (Testing & Review), verify:**

- [ ] S6 completion criteria ALL met
- [ ] All implementation tasks marked complete
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] implementation_checklist.md shows all requirements checked
- [ ] Feature README.md shows:

- Complete S6 missing items

---

## Next Stage

**After completing S6:**

📖 **READ:** `stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md`
🎯 **GOAL:** Validate implementation through smoke testing (3 parts - MANDATORY GATE)
⏱️ **ESTIMATE:** 30-45 minutes

**Then continue with:**
- `stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md` - Feature QC Validation Loop (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
- `stages/s7/s7_p3_final_review.md` - PR review and lessons learned

**S7 (Testing & Review) will:**
- Execute 3-part smoke testing protocol (MANDATORY)
- Run Feature QC Validation Loop (17 dimensions, primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
- Follow PR Validation Loop (11 categories + 7 master dimensions)
- Verify 100% requirement completion
- Fix ALL issues immediately (no restart needed - validation loop approach)

**Remember:** Use the phase transition prompt from `prompts_reference_v2.md` when starting S7 (Testing & Review).
