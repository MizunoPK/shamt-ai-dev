## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL

**BEFORE starting Feature QC — including when resuming a prior session — you MUST:**

1. **Read the validation loop guide:** `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md`
   - Understand 17 dimensions (7 master + 10 S7 QC-specific)
   - Review fresh eyes patterns per round
   - Understand sub-agent confirmation exit criteria
   - Study master protocol: `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md`

2. **Use the phase transition prompt** from `prompts_reference_v2.md`
   - Find "Starting S7.P2: Feature QC Validation Loop" prompt
   - Acknowledge requirements
   - List critical requirements from validation loop guide

3. **Update README Agent Status** with:
   - Current Phase: S7.P2 (Feature QC Validation Loop)
   - Current Guide: reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md
   - Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
   - Critical Rules: "17 dimensions checked every round", "sub-agent confirmation required to exit", "Fix issues immediately (no restart)", "100% tests passing"
   - Next Action: Validation Round 1 - Sequential Review + Test Verification

4. **Verify all prerequisites** (see checklist below)

5. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** begin validation loop

**This is NOT optional.** Reading the validation loop guide ensures you check all 17 dimensions systematically.

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Declare QC "complete" without completing the sub-agent confirmation — see `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` Exit Criteria for the required sequence
- Skip the Code Inspection Protocol (MANDATORY) by reviewing code from memory
- Exit before sub-agent confirmation without completing the required exit sequence (see `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` Exit Criteria)
- Skip dimensions because "the feature was carefully implemented"

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

---

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
Feature QC validates implemented features through systematic validation loop checking 17 dimensions (7 master + 10 S7-specific) every primary round until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved.

**When do you use this guide?**
- S7.P1 complete (Smoke Testing passed all 3 parts)
- S6 execution complete (all implementation done)
- Ready for comprehensive quality validation
- Before S7.P3 (Final Review)

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ All 17 dimensions validated every round
- ✅ Primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved (zero issues found)
- ✅ 100% tests passing (verified every round)
- ✅ All spec requirements implemented (100% coverage)
- ✅ All integration points verified and working
- ✅ Zero tech debt (no TODOs, no partial implementations)
- ✅ Ready for S7.P3 (Final Review)

**Time Estimate:**
4-5 hours (typically 6-8 validation rounds)

**Exit Condition:**
Feature QC is complete when primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved (both independent sub-agents confirm zero issues across all 17 dimensions), all tests passing (100%), and feature is production-ready

**Model Selection for Token Optimization (SHAMT-27):**

Feature QC can save 30-40% tokens through delegation:

```text
Primary Agent (Opus):
├─ Spawn Haiku → Run tests, count files, verify file existence
├─ Spawn Sonnet → Read implementation code for dimension checks
├─ Primary handles → 17-dimension validation, deep correctness checks, test analysis
├─ Spawn Haiku (2x in parallel) → Sub-agent confirmations (exit criteria)
└─ Primary writes → Validation log, issue fixes
```

**See:** `reference/model_selection.md` for Task tool examples.

## 🛑 Critical Rules

**📖 See `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` for universal validation loop principles.**

**S7.P2 Feature QC rules:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - Copy to README Agent Status                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ ALL 17 DIMENSIONS CHECKED EVERY ROUND
   - 7 master dimensions (universal)
   - 10 S7 QC dimensions (feature-specific)
   - Cannot skip any dimension
   - Re-read entire codebase each round (no working from memory)

2. ⚠️ SUB-AGENT CONFIRMATION REQUIRED TO EXIT
   - Clean round = ZERO issues OR exactly 1 LOW-severity issue (fixed)
   - Counter resets if: 2+ LOW issues OR any MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL issue
   - See `reference/severity_classification_universal.md` for severity definitions
   - After primary declares one clean round: spawn 2 independent sub-agents for parallel confirmation (see master protocol Exit Criteria)
   - Typical: 4-7 primary rounds to reach clean, then sub-agent confirmation

3. ⚠️ FIX ISSUES IMMEDIATELY (NO RESTART PROTOCOL)
   - If issues found → Fix ALL immediately
   - Re-run tests after fixes (must pass 100%)
   - Continue validation from current round (no restart needed)
   - New approach: Fix and continue vs old: Fix and restart from beginning

4. ⚠️ 100% TESTS PASSING MANDATORY
   - Run ALL tests EVERY validation round
   - Must achieve 100% pass rate
   - Any test failure = issue (must fix before next round)
   - Verify tests still pass after code changes

5. ⚠️ ZERO TECH DEBT TOLERANCE
   - "90% complete" = INCOMPLETE (must finish)
   - "Placeholder values" = INCOMPLETE (must replace)
   - "Will finish later" = NOT ACCEPTABLE (finish now)
   - NO TODOs, NO temporary solutions, NO deferred features

6. ⚠️ FRESH EYES EVERY ROUND
   - Take 2-5 minute break between rounds
   - Re-read ENTIRE codebase using Read tool
   - Use different reading patterns each round
   - Assume everything is wrong (skeptical fresh perspective)
```

**Validation Loop Principles (from master protocol):**
- Assume everything is wrong (start each round skeptical)
- Fresh eyes required (break + re-read between rounds)
- Zero deferred issues (fix ALL before next round)
- Exit only after primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation
- See `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` for complete principles

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

**Verify these BEFORE starting Validation Loop:**

**From S7.P1:**
- [ ] All 3 smoke test parts passed
- [ ] Part 3 verified OUTPUT DATA VALUES (not just "file exists")
- [ ] Feature executes end-to-end without crashes
- [ ] Output data is correct and reasonable

**Tests (conditional on Testing Approach from EPIC_README):**
- [ ] Options C/D: Run unit tests → `{TEST_COMMAND}` exit code 0, 100% pass rate
- [ ] Options B/D: Run integration scripts → exit code 0
- [ ] Option A: No automated tests required

**Documentation:**
- [ ] `implementation_checklist.md` all requirements verified
- [ ] Smoke test results documented in README Agent Status

**Code Quality (if project has linter configured):**
- [ ] Linter passes: `{LINT_COMMAND}` exit code 0 (or N/A if no linter configured)

**If ANY prerequisite not met:** Return to S7.P1 and complete it first.

---

## ⚠️ Insufficient vs Rigorous Validation - Examples

**CRITICAL:** This section was added after Feature 01 (field experience) revealed insufficient validation quality in initial rounds.

**Context:** Agent completed 3 rounds but validation was "checkbox exercise" not rigorous investigation. User challenged quality, agent restarted with true fresh eyes, immediately found critical security vulnerability (path traversal).

**Lesson:** "Fresh eyes" validation must be GENUINE (not checkbox exercise) to catch security issues.

---

### ❌ INSUFFICIENT VALIDATION (Checkbox Approach)

**Characteristics:**
- Going R1→R2→R3 without breaks (no mental reset)
- Relying on memory from previous rounds
- Generic findings with no evidence: "Code looks good ✅"
- No specific file:line references
- Skimming code instead of reading line-by-line
- Assuming design decisions are correct (confirmation bias)
- Not questioning why code is written a certain way
- Not using empirical verification (grep_search, read_file)

**Example (Insufficient):**
```text
Round 1: Code Quality ✅
- All files reviewed
- Error handling present
- No issues found

Round 2: Clean ✅
- Code still looks good
- Tests passing
- Ready to proceed
```

**Why This Fails:**
- No evidence provided (which files? which lines?)
- No skepticism ("still looks good" assumes R1 was correct)
- No different perspective (same superficial review)
- Critical issues missed (security vulnerabilities, logic errors)

---

### ✅ RIGOROUS VALIDATION (Fresh Eyes Approach)

**Characteristics:**
- Simulate breaks between rounds (clear mental model completely)
- Re-read ALL files with Read tool each round (not from memory)
- Skeptical mindset: "Assume everything is wrong, hunt for problems"
- Specific findings with empirical evidence (file:line references)
- Question every design decision explicitly
- Use grep_search for empirical verification
- Different reading patterns each round (sequential, reverse, random)
- Deep investigation of "suspicious" areas

**Example (Rigorous):**
```text
Round 1 RESTART: Sequential Review - TRUE Fresh Eyes
- Read spec.md lines 95-280 FIRST (understand requirements before checking code)
- serve_image endpoint (routes/image_generation.py lines 177-234):
  * Line 190: filename param from user - NO VALIDATION ❌
  * Attack vector: GET /temp_images/../../backend/src/llm_config.py
  * Could read ANY file in backend directory
  * CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - Path Traversal Vulnerability
- Fix applied: Filename validation + path resolution + boundary check
- Tests verified: Still pass (74 passed, 3 skipped)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Spec read first (requirements before implementation)
- Specific file:line evidence provided
- Skeptical investigation found actual vulnerability
- Fix applied immediately with verification
- Critical issue caught that checkbox validation missed

---

### Self-Check Checklist: "Am I Truly Using Fresh Eyes?"

**Before declaring round "clean", honestly answer:**

- [ ] **Did I re-read entire codebase THIS round (not from memory)?**
  - If NO: Not fresh eyes, using cached assumptions
  
- [ ] **Did I question design decisions (not just accept them)?**
  - If NO: Confirmation bias, not skeptical enough
  
- [ ] **Did I use grep_search for empirical verification?**
  - If NO: Assumptions instead of evidence-based validation
  
- [ ] **Did I find at LEAST one thing to investigate deeply?**
  - If NO: Probably skimming, not investigating
  
- [ ] **Would I bet my reputation this code is bug-free?**
  - If NO: Not confident enough, found something suspicious
  
- [ ] **Did I check security implications (path traversal, injection, XSS)?**
  - If NO: Security vulnerabilities likely missed
  
- [ ] **Did I verify error handling for EVERY failure scenario?**
  - If NO: Edge cases and error paths not fully validated

**If NO to ANY question:** Not rigorous enough. Take break, restart round with fresh eyes.

---

### Adversarial Linter Check (Required Before Declaring Round Clean)

Before scoring a round as clean, explicitly answer:

> "What would ESLint/Ruff/CodeQL flag in this code that I haven't checked?"

Consider:
- [ ] Unused variables or imports?
- [ ] Operator confusion (= vs ==, == vs ===)?
- [ ] Missing null/undefined checks?
- [ ] Unreachable code after return/throw?
- [ ] Inconsistent string quotes or formatting?
- [ ] Type coercion issues?
- [ ] Security patterns (eval, innerHTML, SQL string concat)?

A round may NOT be scored clean if this check is skipped.

---

### Historical Example: Path Traversal Vulnerability (Feature 01)

**Initial Validation (INSUFFICIENT):**
- Rounds 1-3: "No issues found ✅" 
- serve_image endpoint reviewed but no security concerns flagged
- User challenged: "Did you correctly do full processing?"

**RESTART Validation (RIGOROUS):**
- Round 1 RESTART: Read spec FIRST, then code with skepticism
- Found immediately: filename param has no validation
- Recognized attack vector: `GET /temp_images/../../backend/src/llm_config.py`
- Impact: Could read configuration files with API keys
- Fix: Filename validation + path resolution + boundary check

**Conclusion:** Rigorous validation caught critical security issue that checkbox validation missed.

## Workflow Overview

**📖 See `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md` for complete validation loop protocol.**

**S7.P2 Validation Loop Process:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     S7.P2 FEATURE QC VALIDATION LOOP (Until Primary Clean + Sub-Agents) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PREPARATION
   ↓ Read validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md
   ↓ Create VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md
   ↓ Run ALL tests (must pass 100%)

ROUND 1: Sequential Review + Test Verification
   ↓ Check ALL 17 dimensions (7 master + 10 S7 QC)
   ↓ Run tests, read code sequentially, verify requirements
   ↓
   If issues found → Fix ALL immediately → Re-run tests → Round 2
   If clean → Round 2 (count = 1)

ROUND 2: Reverse Review + Integration Focus
   ↓ Check ALL 17 dimensions again (fresh eyes)
   ↓ Run tests, read code in reverse, focus on integration
   ↓
   If issues found → Fix ALL immediately → Re-run tests → Round 3
   If clean → Round 3 (count = 2 or 1 depending on previous)

ROUND 3+: Continue Until Primary Clean Round
   ↓ Check ALL 17 dimensions (different reading patterns)
   ↓ Run tests, spot-checks, E2E verification
   ↓
   Continue until primary clean round achieved → spawn 2 sub-agents for parallel confirmation
   ↓
VALIDATION COMPLETE → Proceed to S7.P3 (Final Review)
```

**Key Difference from Old Approach:**
- **Old:** 3 sequential rounds checking different concerns → Any issue → Restart from S7.P1
- **New:** N rounds checking ALL concerns → Fix issues immediately → Continue until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation

**VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md:** Create this file at the start of S7.P2 in the feature folder. Log each round's findings, issues fixed, and clean round counter. Format:
```markdown
## Validation Loop Log - {feature_name}

## Round 1 (Sequential Review)
- Issues Found: [list or "None"]
- Fixes Applied: [list or "N/A"]
- Clean Count: 0 (or 1 if no issues)

## Round 2 (Reverse Review)
...
~~~text

**Time Savings:** 60-180 min per bug (no restart overhead)

---

## Pre-Validation Context Gathering (Before Round 1)

**Purpose:** Gather structured context before starting validation rounds, similar to how automated code reviewers index the repo before reviewing.

**Run these commands and document results in VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md:**

### 1. Change Summary
```
git diff --stat HEAD~N  # or vs feature branch base
```text
Document: Total files changed, lines added/removed

### 2. Deferred Work Scan
```
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" {feature_folder}/
```text
Document: Count and locations of deferred work markers (should be ZERO for clean validation)

### 3. Import/Dependency Analysis (if linter available)
- Python: `ruff check --select F401 .` (unused imports)
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals`

Document: Any findings

### 4. Type Coverage (if applicable)
- Python: `mypy {feature_folder}/ --ignore-missing-imports`
- TypeScript: Check for `any` usage

Document: Type errors or coverage gaps

### 5. Test Status
```
{TEST_COMMAND}
```text
Document: Pass/fail count, any skipped tests

**Only proceed to Round 1 after context gathering is complete and documented.**

## Detailed Validation Process

**🚨 FOLLOW THE COMPLETE VALIDATION LOOP GUIDE:**

**Primary guide:** `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md`

This guide contains:
- Complete 17-dimension checklist (7 master + 10 S7 QC)
- Fresh eyes patterns for each round
- Common issues with examples
- Exit criteria details
- Example validation round sequence

**Do NOT attempt to run S7.P2 without reading the validation loop guide.**

**Quick Summary of What to Check:**

**Master Dimensions (7):**
1. Empirical Verification - All interfaces verified from source
2. Completeness - All requirements implemented
3. Internal Consistency - No contradictions
4. Traceability - All code traces to requirements
5. Clarity & Specificity - Clear naming, specific errors
6. Upstream Alignment - Matches spec and implementation plan
7. Standards Compliance - Follows project standards

**S7 QC Dimensions (10):**
8. Cross-Feature Integration - Integration points work
9. Error Handling Completeness - All errors handled gracefully
10. End-to-End Functionality - Complete user flow works
11. Test Coverage Quality - 100% tests passing, adequate coverage
12. Requirements Completion - 100% complete, zero tech debt
13. Import & Dependency Hygiene - No unused imports, correct dep groups
14. Cross-Layer & Type Consistency - Frontend types mirror backend, shared constants
15. Input Validation & Path Safety - Allowlists, strict decoding, absolute paths
16. Test Stub Consistency - Mock return values match mock state
17. Mechanical Code Quality - Linter checks, code patterns

**Detailed checklists for dimensions 13-16:**

**Dim 13 — Import & Dependency Hygiene:**
- [ ] No unused imports in ANY changed file (grep for each import, verify it's referenced)
- [ ] Every new dependency in pyproject.toml/package.json is actually imported somewhere in src/
- [ ] Test-only deps (pytest, pytest-asyncio) are in dev/optional group, not main [dependencies]
- [ ] No stale imports left after refactoring (removed function → removed import)
- Quick check: `ruff check --select F401 {changed_files}` or `npx tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals`

**Dim 14 — Cross-Layer & Type Consistency:**
- [ ] Frontend TypeScript types mirror backend Pydantic model constraints exactly
  - Backend `Literal["jpeg", "png"]` → Frontend `"jpeg" | "png"` (NOT `string`)
  - Backend `int` with `Field(ge=0)` → Frontend with matching runtime validation
- [ ] Data flows through the FULL pipeline with consistent metadata (provider → route → response → storage → display)
- [ ] Frontend timeouts >= backend worst-case execution time (with buffer)
- [ ] Constants used in multiple modules are shared (single source of truth), not independently constructed
- [ ] UI copy uses consistent terminology per page (don't mix "Assets" and "Images")

**Dim 15 — Input Validation & Path Safety:**
- [ ] All user-addressable endpoints validate/allowlist inputs (no `else: default`)
- [ ] Data integrity operations use strict mode (e.g., `base64.b64decode(data, validate=True)`)
- [ ] External data load functions (localStorage, API responses) validate individual entry shapes
- [ ] File paths are absolute or derived from `__file__`, NEVER relative to CWD
- [ ] `exc_info=True` in logging is only used inside `except` blocks
- [ ] Module-level side effects (logging.basicConfig, load_dotenv) are in entrypoints, not library modules

**Dim 16 — Test Stub Consistency:**
- [ ] Mock/stub return values are internally consistent with mock state
  - If mock_output.output_format = "jpeg", then save_image stub should return ".jpeg" URL
  - Assertions should match what the real code would produce given the mock state

**See validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md for detailed checklists for each dimension.**
```

---

## 🚨 Code Inspection Protocol (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** QC rounds require ACTUAL code inspection, not checkbox validation.

**Historical Context (SHAMT-1 Feature 01):**
- Agent claimed "error handling verified" in Validation Round 1
- Actually: Agent didn't read the file, just assumed it was correct
- Result: Missing `set -e` in shell script passed through multiple validation rounds
- Caught only when user asked "did you actually review the code?"
- **This protocol prevents that anti-pattern**

---

### For EVERY file modified/created in this feature:

**Step 1: OPEN THE FILE**
- Use Read tool to load the actual file contents
- Do NOT rely on memory or assumptions
- Do NOT skip this step even if you "know what's in the file"

**Step 2: READ EVERY LINE**
- Not just skim - actually read each line
- Check for commented code, debug statements, TODOs
- Verify code matches implementation plan

**Step 3: VERIFY AGAINST CHECKLIST**
- Line-by-line comparison against QC checklist items
- Provide specific evidence (line numbers, actual code)
- Never say "verified ✅" without showing the evidence

---

### Example - Correct Code Inspection:

❌ **WRONG APPROACH:**
```text
Validation 1.2: Code Structure
- Error handling: ✅ Present
- File structure: ✅ Correct
- Code conventions: ✅ Followed
```

✅ **CORRECT APPROACH:**
```text
Validation 1.2: Code Structure

Opening file: [module]/RecordManager.py

Line 45-52: load_rank_data() method
- Error handling present: ✅
  - Line 48: try/except FileNotFoundError
  - Line 50: error logged with context
  - Line 51: returns empty list (graceful degradation)
- Return type matches spec: ✅
  - Returns List[Tuple[str, str, int]]
  - Line 52: return rank_data
- Docstring complete: ✅
  - Lines 45-51: Google style docstring with Args, Returns, Raises

File structure verified: All imports at top (lines 1-8), methods organized by feature
Code conventions verified: Follows CODING_STANDARDS.md (type hints, error context, logging)
```

**Notice the difference:**
- ❌ Wrong: Claims verification without evidence
- ✅ Correct: Shows actual lines inspected, quotes code, provides proof

---

### Why This Matters:

**Without Code Inspection Protocol:**
- Agents claim to verify without reading files
- Issues slip through to PR review or user testing
- QC rounds become meaningless checkbox exercise
- User intervention required (should be caught by agent)

**With Code Inspection Protocol:**
- Agents read actual code before claiming verification
- Issues caught during QC (as designed)
- Evidence-based validation (line numbers, quotes)
- User can trust QC results

---

### Red Flags - Signs You're NOT Inspecting Code:

- ❌ "Verified all requirements ✅" without file reads
- ❌ No line numbers in your validation report
- ❌ No code quotes or examples
- ❌ Generic statements like "looks good"
- ❌ Validating 10+ files in 5 minutes
- ❌ Round 1, 2, and 3 all have identical results

**If you see these patterns, STOP and actually read the code.**

---

## Validation Round Execution

⚠️ **Before starting Round 1, confirm:**
- [ ] I will not stop after the first round that appears clean — I must trigger sub-agent confirmation
- [ ] I will spawn 2 independent sub-agents after my first clean round and wait for both to confirm zero issues before exiting
- [ ] I will not proceed to S7.P3 until sub-agent confirmation is complete (see master protocol Exit Criteria)

---

**For complete validation round instructions, see:**
- `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md` - Complete 17-dimension checklist
- `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` - Core validation loop principles

**Each validation round:**
1. Check ALL 17 dimensions (7 master + 10 S7 QC-specific)
2. Run all tests (must pass 100%)
3. Fix ANY issues found immediately
4. Take 2-5 minute break before next round
5. Continue until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved

**Key difference from old approach:**
- **Old (v1.0):** 3 sequential rounds checking different concerns, restart from S7.P1 on any issue
- **New (v2.0):** N rounds checking ALL concerns, fix immediately and continue (no restart needed)

---

## Common Feature-Specific Issues

### Issue 1: Partial Implementation

**Symptom:** Feature "mostly works" but some requirements incomplete

**Example:**
```markdown
Spec requirement: "Update 6 position files (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)"
Implementation: Only updated 4 files (QB, RB, WR, TE)
Agent thought: "80% is good enough, I'll finish the rest later"
```

**Fix:** This is INCOMPLETE. Either implement ALL 6 or get user approval to reduce scope.

### Issue 2: Structure Without Data

**Symptom:** Output files exist with correct structure but wrong values

**Example:**
```python
## WRONG - creates structure but uses placeholders
for item in items:
    ratings.append({'name': item.name, 'rating': 1.0})  # All 1.0!

## CORRECT - actually calculates values
for item in items:
    rating = calculate_rating(item)  # Real calculation
    ratings.append({'name': item.name, 'rating': rating})
```

**Fix:** Verify algorithms ACTUALLY execute (not just create placeholders)

### Issue 3: Spec Drift

**Symptom:** Implementation doesn't match spec because spec was misremembered

**Example:**
```markdown
Spec says: "Clamp rating between 0.5 and 1.5"
Code does: rating = max(0, min(2.0, rating))  # Wrong range!
```

**Fix:** Round 3 fresh-eyes spec review catches this. ALWAYS re-read spec with fresh eyes.

---

## MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 1

**Both sub-agents have confirmed zero issues (exit condition met)**

STOP - DO NOT PROCEED TO S7.P3 YET

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read "Critical Rules" section of this guide
2. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md` (17 dimensions)
3. [ ] Verify primary clean round and sub-agent confirmation documented in VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md
4. [ ] Verify ZERO issues remain (scan implementation one more time)
5. [ ] Update feature README Agent Status:
   - Current Guide: "stages/s7/s7_p3_final_review.md"
   - Current Step: "S7.P2 complete (sub-agent confirmation passed), ready to start S7.P3"
   - Last Updated: [timestamp]
6. [ ] Output acknowledgment: "CHECKPOINT 1 COMPLETE: Re-read Critical Rules, verified primary clean round and sub-agent confirmation, ZERO issues"

**Why this checkpoint exists:**
- Ensures validation loop was properly executed
- Confirms all 17 dimensions checked every primary round
- 3 minutes of verification prevents hours of rework

**ONLY after completing ALL 6 actions above, proceed to Next Steps section**

---

## Next Steps

**If sub-agent confirmation passed:**
- Document QC results in feature README
- Update Agent Status: "S7.P2 COMPLETE (sub-agent confirmation passed, zero issues)"
- Proceed to **S7.P3: Final Review**

**If still finding issues:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately (no deferring)
- Re-run tests (must pass 100%)
- Continue validation loop until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation
- Do NOT proceed to Final Review until validation complete

---

**For complete validation loop protocol, see:**
`reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md`


## Exit Criteria

S7.P2 is complete when the Validation Loop exits: primary agent declares one clean round (ZERO issues OR exactly ONE LOW-severity issue fixed, all 17 dimensions) AND both independent sub-agents confirm zero issues. Agent Status is updated. **If `shamt.validation_round()` MCP tool is registered, call it after scoring each round with `exit_threshold=1`.**

### Sub-Agent Confirmation Protocol

When `consecutive_clean = 1` (primary clean round achieved), EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING TASK TOOL CALLS IN A SINGLE MESSAGE:

```xml
<invoke name="Task">

  <parameter name="description">Confirm zero issues in feature QC (sub-agent A)</parameter>
  <parameter name="prompt">You are sub-agent A confirming zero issues in feature QC validation.

**Artifact to validate:** Feature {feature_NN} implemented code
**Validation dimensions:** All 17 dimensions (7 master + 10 S7 QC) from reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md
**Your task:** Review the entire feature implementation and verify ALL dimensions.

CRITICAL: Report ANY issue found, even LOW severity. If zero issues found, state "CONFIRMED: Zero issues found".

Check: Empirical verification, completeness, consistency, traceability, clarity, upstream alignment, standards, cross-feature integration, error handling, end-to-end functionality, test coverage (100% passing), requirements completion, imports, types, input validation, test stubs.

**Why Haiku?** Sub-agent confirmations are focused verification (70-80% token savings per SHAMT-27). See `reference/model_selection.md`.

**What happens next:**
- Both confirm zero issues → S7.P2 complete, proceed to S7.P3 (Final Review) ✅
- Either finds issues → Reset consecutive_clean = 0, fix issues, continue validation loop

---

## Next Phase

**After completing S7.P2 (sub-agent confirmation passed), proceed to:**
- **Phase:** S7.P3 — Final Review
- **Guide:** `stages/s7/s7_p3_final_review.md`

**See also:**
- `stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md` — S7.P1 (Smoke Testing, must pass before QC rounds)
- `reference/validation_loop_s7_feature_qc.md` — Full validation loop protocol for S7
