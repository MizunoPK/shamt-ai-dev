   - Find "Starting S7.P3" prompt
   - Speak it out loud (acknowledge requirements)
   - List critical requirements from this guide

2. **Update README Agent Status** with:
   - Current Phase: S7.P3 (Final Review - PR Validation Loop)
   - Current Guide: reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md
   - Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
   - Critical Rules: "3 consecutive clean rounds required", "All 11 PR categories checked every round", "Update guides immediately", "100% completion required"
   - Next Action: Begin PR Validation Loop Round 1

3. **Verify all prerequisites** (see checklist below)

4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** begin final review

**This is NOT optional.** Reading this guide ensures production-ready quality.

---

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
Final Review validates production readiness through PR validation loop (7 master dimensions + QC/PR criteria), applies lessons learned to guides immediately, and verifies 100% completion.

**When do you use this guide?**
- S7.P2 complete (Feature QC validation loop passed)
- Ready for final production readiness validation
- Before cross-feature alignment

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ PR validation loop complete (3 consecutive clean rounds)
- ✅ All 11 PR categories checked (code quality, testing, security, etc.)
- ✅ lessons_learned.md updated
- ✅ Workflow guides updated immediately (lessons applied, not just documented)
- ✅ Final verification passed (100% completion confirmed)
- ✅ Ready for S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment)

**Time Estimate:**
2-3 hours (PR validation loop typically 4-6 rounds)

**Exit Condition:**
Final Review is complete when 3 consecutive validation rounds find ZERO issues across all categories, lessons learned are applied to guides (not just documented), 100% completion is verified, and feature is ready for commit

│ CRITICAL RULES - These MUST be copied to README Agent Status │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ ALL 11 PR CATEGORIES CHECKED EVERY ROUND
   - Cannot skip any category
   - Each category catches different issues
   - Check all categories every validation round (not just once)
   - Must document findings for ALL categories

2. ⚠️ 3 CONSECUTIVE CLEAN ROUNDS REQUIRED
   - Clean = ZERO issues across all 11 categories
   - Counter resets if ANY issue found
   - Cannot exit early (must achieve 3 consecutive)
   - Typical: 4-6 rounds total to achieve 3 consecutive clean

3. ⚠️ FIX ISSUES IMMEDIATELY (NO RESTART)
   - If issues found → Fix ALL immediately
   - Critical issues (correctness, security): Must fix before next round
   - Minor issues: Must fix before next round (no deferring)
   - Continue validation (no restart to S7.P2)

4. ⚠️ LESSONS LEARNED MUST UPDATE GUIDES
   - If you discover guide gaps → update guides IMMEDIATELY
   - Don't just document the lesson → apply it to guides
   - Update relevant guide files before completing S7.P3
   - This is NOT optional

5. ⚠️ 100% REQUIREMENT COMPLETION - ZERO TECH DEBT TOLERANCE
   - Feature is DONE or NOT DONE (no partial credit, no "90% done")
   - ALL spec requirements must be implemented 100%
   - ALL checklist items must be verified and resolved
   - NO "we'll add that later" items allowed
   - NO deferred features, shortcuts, or "temporary" solutions
   - NO tech debt - if it's in the spec, it's REQUIRED and must be fully implemented
   - If something cannot be implemented, get user approval to REMOVE from scope
   - Clean codebase with zero compromises - every requirement fully complete

6. ⚠️ FINAL VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY
   - Cannot skip final verification checklist
   - Must honestly answer: "Would I ship this to production?"
   - If any hesitation → investigate why

7. ⚠️ RE-READING CHECKPOINT
   - Before declaring complete → re-read Completion Criteria

## Step 1: PR Review (Validation Loop)

**🚨 MANDATORY: READ PR VALIDATION LOOP GUIDE**

**Before proceeding, you MUST:**
1. **READ:** `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md` (PR Validation Loop - v2.0)
2. **READ:** `reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md` (Master protocol with 7 universal dimensions)
3. **Follow the complete validation loop approach:**
   - Check all 11 PR categories EVERY round
   - Use fresh eyes patterns (re-read code, different reading orders)
   - 3 consecutive clean rounds required (standard)
   - Fix issues immediately, continue validation

**Purpose:** Systematic PR validation through comprehensive multi-round review.

**Validation Loop Principles:**
- **Assume everything is wrong:** Skeptically verify all code
- **Fresh eyes:** 2-5 min break + re-read entire codebase each round
- **No deferred issues:** Fix ALL issues before next round
- **Exit criteria:** 3 consecutive clean rounds (zero issues)

### Quick Reference: 11-Category Checklist (checked every round)

**For detailed examples and guidance, see `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md`**

### Category 1: Correctness and Logic

- [ ] Does the code accomplish what it claims to do?
- [ ] Any logic errors? (off-by-one, incorrect conditionals, wrong operators)
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions handled?
- [ ] Null/undefined handling appropriate?
- [ ] Calculations are mathematically correct?
- [ ] Loops terminate correctly?

**Common issues:**
- Off-by-one errors in loops (`range(n)` vs `range(n+1)`)
- Wrong comparison operators (`<` vs `<=`)
- Integer division when float needed (`5/2 = 2` in Python 2)

**Example:**
```python
## ❌ Off-by-one error
for i in range(len(items)):  # Correct
    item = items[i]

for i in range(len(items) + 1):  # ❌ Will crash on last iteration
    item = items[i]

## ✅ Correct comparison
if item.priority_rank < 50:  # Top 50 items
    apply_bonus()

if item.priority_rank <= 50:  # Depends on requirement (inclusive vs exclusive)
```

**Document findings:**
```markdown
### Category 1: Correctness and Logic
✅ No issues found
- All loops verified for correct range
- All comparisons checked against spec
- Edge cases tested (empty list, single item, max size)
```

---

### Category 2: Code Quality and Readability

- [ ] Code is easy to understand without excessive mental overhead?
- [ ] Variable/function/class names are descriptive and consistent?
- [ ] Functions are appropriately sized (not doing too much)?
- [ ] Unnecessary complexity that could be simplified?
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)?
- [ ] No "clever" code that's hard to understand?

**Example - Bad vs Good:**
```python
## ❌ BAD - Unclear, does too much
def proc(d):
    r = []
    for x in d:
        if x['s'] > 10:
            r.append({'n': x['n'], 'v': x['s'] * 1.5})
    return sorted(r, key=lambda y: y['v'], reverse=True)

## ✅ GOOD - Clear, focused functions
def filter_high_scorers(items, threshold=10):
    """Return items with score above threshold."""
    return [p for p in items if p['score'] > threshold]

def apply_multiplier(items, multiplier=1.5):
    """Apply multiplier to item scores."""
    return [{'name': p['name'], 'value': p['score'] * multiplier}
            for p in items]

def sort_by_value(items, descending=True):
    """Sort items by value."""
    return sorted(items, key=lambda p: p['value'], reverse=descending)
```

---

### Category 3: Comments and Documentation

- [ ] Comments explain "why" rather than restating "what"?
- [ ] Public APIs adequately documented (docstrings)?
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments?
- [ ] No stale or misleading comments?
- [ ] Type hints present (per CLAUDE.md standards)?
- [ ] **Code quality issues fixed immediately (NOT deferred)?**
  - Check: No "TODO" comments for code quality issues
  - Check: No "will fix later" notes
  - Check: All type hints present and complete (not deferred)
  - Check: All docstrings complete (not marked as "add later")
  - **If ANY issues found: Fix NOW before proceeding**
  - **Remember: "Later" often never comes - zero tech debt tolerance**

**Example:**
```python
## ❌ BAD - Restates code
## Loop through items
for item in items:
    # Add to list
    results.append(item)

## ✅ GOOD - Explains why
## Filter to only rostered items for trade analysis
## (Free agents handled separately in draft mode)
for item in items:
    if item.is_active:
        results.append(item)
```

---

### Category 4: Refactoring Concerns

- [ ] Does change introduce duplication that should be abstracted?
- [ ] Opportunities to improve existing code touched by this change?
- [ ] Change consistent with existing patterns in codebase?
- [ ] Could similar logic be unified?

**Example:**
```python
## ❌ DUPLICATION - Same logic in 3 places
## In DraftHelper:
if item.attribute_status == "Out":
    penalty = -10
elif item.attribute_status == "Questionable":
    penalty = -5

## In TradeSimulator:
if item.attribute_status == "Out":
    penalty = -10
elif item.attribute_status == "Questionable":
    penalty = -5

## ✅ REFACTORED - Unified in ConfigManager
## In ConfigManager:
def get_injury_penalty(self, attribute_status):
    return self.config['injury_penalties'].get(attribute_status, 0)

## In DraftHelper & TradeSimulator:
penalty = config.get_injury_penalty(item.attribute_status)
```

---

### Category 5: Testing

- [ ] Sufficient unit/integration tests for new functionality?
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and failure modes?
- [ ] Existing tests still valid, or need updates?
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just coverage theater)?
- [ ] Mock usage is appropriate (not excessive)?

**Red flags:**
- New feature with zero tests
- Tests that always pass (testing mocks, not real code)
- Tests with no assertions
- Tests that don't actually test the feature

---

### Category 6: Security

- [ ] Input validation and sanitization present?
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks (if applicable)?
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure (logs, errors, responses)?
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)?
- [ ] File path handling safe (no path traversal)?
- [ ] API keys/secrets not hardcoded?

**Common issues:**
- User input used in file paths without validation
- Sensitive data (passwords, API keys) logged
- SQL queries built with string concatenation (SQL injection)

---

### Category 7: Performance

- [ ] No inefficient algorithms or data structures?
- [ ] No unnecessary loops or redundant calculations?
- [ ] Large data handled efficiently (not loading everything in memory)?
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns?
- [ ] Caching used appropriately?

**Example - Performance Issue:**
```python
## ❌ BAD - O(n²) when O(n) possible
for item in all_items:
    for team_item in team_roster:  # Inner loop runs for EACH item
        if item.name == team_item.name:
            item.is_active = True

## ✅ GOOD - O(n) with set lookup
rostered_names = {p.name for p in team_roster}
for item in all_items:
    item.is_active = item.name in rostered_names  # O(1) lookup
```

---

### Category 8: Error Handling

- [ ] Errors caught and handled appropriately?
- [ ] Error messages helpful for debugging?
- [ ] Logging sufficient but not excessive?
- [ ] No bare `except:` clauses (too broad)?
- [ ] Resources cleaned up in error cases (files, connections)?
- [ ] Errors don't expose sensitive info?

**Example:**
```python
## ❌ BAD - Swallows all errors, no info
try:
    load_data()
except:
    pass

## ✅ GOOD - Specific exception, helpful error
try:
    load_data()
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to load record data: {e}")
    raise DataProcessingError("Record data file not found", context=ctx)
```

---

### Category 9: Architecture and Design

- [ ] Change fits overall system architecture?
- [ ] Dependencies flow in right direction (no circular)?
- [ ] Appropriate separation of concerns?
- [ ] Not creating architectural debt?
- [ ] Follows existing patterns in codebase?

**Red flags:**
- Business logic in UI layer
- Tight coupling between unrelated modules
- Circular dependencies
- God objects (classes doing too much)

---

### Category 10: Compatibility and Integration

- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained (if required)?
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs?
- [ ] Configuration changes handled gracefully?
- [ ] Dependencies appropriate and justified?
- [ ] Works with existing features (not just in isolation)?

**Example:**
```python
## ❌ BREAKING CHANGE - Changed method signature
## Before:
def calculate_score(item):
    ...

## After (BREAKS all existing callers):
def calculate_score(item, config):
    ...

## ✅ BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE - Added optional parameter
def calculate_score(item, config=None):
    if config is None:
        config = ConfigManager()
    ...
```

---

### Category 11: Scope and Focus

- [ ] Change addresses stated requirements (not scope creep)?
- [ ] No unnecessary "improvements" beyond spec?
- [ ] Not over-engineered for current needs?
- [ ] Each change has clear justification?

**Example:**
```markdown
Spec requirement: "Add rank multiplier to scoring recommendations"

✅ In scope:
- Calculate rank multiplier
- Apply to draft scores
- Display in recommendations

❌ Out of scope (unless explicitly discussed):
- Redesign entire [domain algorithm]
- Add caching layer for performance
- Create configuration UI for rank weights
- Implement machine learning model for rank prediction
```

---

### PR Review Execution

**Follow the PR Validation Loop Protocol:**

1. **READ:** `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md` (complete protocol)

2. **Follow validation loop approach:**
   - Check ALL 11 categories + 7 master dimensions EVERY round
   - Fresh eyes through breaks + re-reading (NOT agent spawning)
   - Track all findings in `VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md`
   - Continue until 3 consecutive clean rounds

3. **After PR validation PASSED:**
   - Verify VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md shows 3 consecutive clean rounds
   - Proceed to Step 2 (Lessons Learned)

**The 11 categories above are checked every round** - you run the validation loop following the protocol in validation_loop_qc_pr.md.

**See reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md for complete execution instructions.**

---

## Step 2: Lessons Learned Capture

**📖 See `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md` for fresh perspective review approach (optional).**

**Purpose:** Document what went well, what didn't, and UPDATE GUIDES IMMEDIATELY

**CRITICAL:** Don't just document lessons - APPLY them to guides before completing S7.P3

**Fresh Perspective Approach (Optional):**
- Re-read lessons with fresh eyes after initial drafting
- Check for patterns (similar issues across phases)
- Verify lessons are actionable (not just observations)
- Ensure guide updates are specific (not vague improvements)

---

### Lessons Learned Process

**1. Review what went well:**
- What aspects of implementation went smoothly?
- What parts of the guides were helpful?
- What practices prevented issues?

**2. Review what didn't go well:**
- What issues were discovered in QC/smoke testing?
- What was unclear in the guides?
- What steps were skipped/missed?
- What caused rework?

**3. Identify guide gaps:**
- Are there missing steps in guides that would have helped?
- Are there unclear instructions that caused confusion?
- Are there missing examples that would clarify?
- Are there missing anti-patterns to document?

**4. UPDATE GUIDES IMMEDIATELY:**

This is NOT optional. If you found guide gaps, fix them NOW.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Lesson Learned:

Issue: Validation Loop found all output data was zeros
Root cause: Smoke test Part 3 only checked "file exists", didn't verify data VALUES
Guide gap: stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md didn't emphasize DATA VALUES enough

Action taken: Updated S7.P1 guide
- Added "CRITICAL - Verify OUTPUT DATA" to Part 3 heading
- Added real-world example of zero data issue
- Added explicit "Don't just check file exists" warning
- Added code example showing good vs bad Part 3 validation

Files updated:
- .shamt/guides/stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md
```

**5. Update lessons_learned.md:**

```markdown
## Feature_XX Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Smoke testing caught integration bug that unit tests missed
- Validation Loop baseline comparison revealed pattern inconsistency
- PR Review Category 5 (Testing) identified missing edge case tests

### What Didn't Go Well
- Initial smoke test Part 3 only checked file existence (not data values)
- Required QC restart after Round 1 due to mock assumption failures
- 3 hours spent debugging issue that better interface verification would have caught

### Root Causes
- Guide didn't emphasize DATA VALUES enough in smoke testing
- Skipped Interface Verification Protocol in S6 (assumed interface)
- Excessive mocking in tests hid real integration issues

### Guide Updates Applied
1. Updated stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md:
   - Enhanced smoke test Part 3 with DATA VALUES emphasis
   - Added real-world example of zero data issue

2. Updated stages/s6/s6_execution.md:
   - Made Interface Verification Protocol STEP 1 (not optional)
   - Added "NO coding from memory" critical rule

3. Updated stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md:
   - Enhanced Mock Audit (iteration 21) with "excessive mocking" anti-pattern

### Recommendations for Future Features
- ALWAYS verify data VALUES in smoke tests (not just structure)
- NEVER skip Interface Verification Protocol
- Use mocks only for I/O, not internal classes
- If in doubt about interface, READ THE SOURCE CODE

### Time Impact
- Guide gaps cost: ~3 hours debugging + 2 hours rework
- Following guides correctly would have saved: ~5 hours
- QC restart added: ~2 hours (but prevented larger issues later)
```

---

## Step 3: Final Verification

**Purpose:** Confirm all completion criteria met before transitioning to S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment)

---

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Documenting Lessons But Not Applying Them

**❌ Mistake:**
```markdown
## Lessons Learned
- S7.P1 guide should emphasize data values more

{End of feature work - guide never updated}
```

**Why wrong:** Next feature will hit same issue because guide wasn't fixed

**✅ Correct:** UPDATE GUIDES IMMEDIATELY when gaps found (Step 2)

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Ignoring Minor Issues

**❌ Mistake:**
"PR Review found missing docstrings, but that's minor, I'll skip documenting it"

**Why wrong:**
- Minor issues accumulate → technical debt
- Missing docstrings → harder maintenance
- Not documenting → issue gets forgotten

**✅ Correct:** Document ALL issues (critical AND minor), even if not blocking

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: "Good Enough" Mentality

**❌ Mistake:**
"Feature mostly works, 90% of data is correct, ship it"

**Why wrong:**
- 10% wrong data → untrustworthy results → users abandon feature
- "Good enough" compounds → technical debt
- Critical Rule: NO PARTIAL WORK

**✅ Correct:** 100% requirement completion, or feature is INCOMPLETE

### Anti-Pattern 4: Skipping Final Verification

**❌ Mistake:**
"I did PR review and lessons learned, that's enough"

**Why wrong:** Final Verification catches edge cases missed in earlier steps

**✅ Correct:** Actually work through Final Verification Checklist (all boxes)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Lessons Learned Updates Prevent Future Issues

**Feature:** Schedule strength multiplier

**Issue found in Validation Loop:**
```text
Log quality check: 487 WARNING messages during normal execution
Investigation: Most are "Opponent data missing for week {week}, using default"

Root cause: Schedule data only loaded for weeks 1-17
Code tries to access week 18 (doesn't exist in regular season)
Should use INFO level, not WARNING (this is expected behavior)
```

**Developer's actions:**
1. Fixed log level (WARNING → INFO)
2. Added documentation about 17-week schedule
3. **Updated S7.P2 guide:**
   - Added "Log Quality Verification" example
   - Added "Expected vs Unexpected warnings" distinction
   - Added this real-world example to guide

**Result:** Next feature developer read updated guide, avoided same issue

**Lesson:** Updating guides immediately prevents future features from hitting same issues.

### Example 2: PR Review Catches Scope Creep

**Feature:** Add rank multiplier to scoring recommendations

**PR Review Category 11 (Scope):**
```markdown
Spec requirement: "Add rank multiplier to scoring recommendations"

Code review found:
✅ In scope:
- Calculate rank multiplier
- Apply to draft scores
- Display in recommendations

⚠️ Out of scope (not in spec):
- NEW: Caching layer for rank data (250 lines of code)
- NEW: Admin UI for configuring rank weights (180 lines of code)
- NEW: rank priority trend analysis over time (320 lines of code)

Total: 750 lines of unspecified code (30% of feature)

Issue: Scope creep - added features not in spec
Decision: Remove out-of-scope code or get user approval
```

**Resolution:**
- Asked user if these additions were wanted
- User said: "No, just the basic rank multiplier for now"
- Removed 750 lines of unspecified code
- Feature size reduced 30%
- Complexity reduced significantly

**Lesson:** PR Review Category 11 catches scope creep before it's shipped

### Completion Verification
- [ ] All S7.P3 completion criteria met (see Completion Criteria section)
- [ ] All smoke tests passed (3 parts)
- [ ] All QC rounds passed (3 rounds)
- [ ] PR review complete (11 categories)
- [ ] Lessons learned captured AND guides updated

### Files Verified
- [ ] lessons_learned.md updated
- [ ] implementation_checklist.md all verified
- [ ] Guides updated if gaps found

### Git Status
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Working directory clean
- [ ] Descriptive commit messages

### README Agent Status
- [ ] Updated to reflect S7.P3 completion
- [ ] Next action set to "Read stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md"

### Final Check
- [ ] Feature is COMPLETE (not just functional)
- [ ] Would ship to production with confidence
- [ ] 100% requirement completion (no partial work)

**If ALL verified:** Ready for S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment)

**S8.P1 (Cross-Feature Alignment) Preview:**
- Review all REMAINING (not-yet-implemented) feature specs
- Compare to ACTUAL implementation (not plan) of just-completed feature
- Update specs if implementation revealed changes/insights
- Ensure remaining features align with reality

**Next step:** Read stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md and use phase transition prompt

## Summary

**S7.P3 validates production readiness through:**
1. **PR Review** - 11 categories ensure code quality, security, correctness
2. **Lessons Learned** - Capture insights and apply improvements to guides
3. **Final Verification** - Confirm 100% completion and readiness

**Critical protocols:**
- All 11 PR categories mandatory (each catches different issues)
- Update guides immediately when gaps found (don't just document)
- 100% completion required (no partial work)
- Final verification confirms "actually complete" not just "functional"

**Success criteria:**
- PR review complete (zero critical issues)
- Lessons learned captured and guides updated
- Final verification passed (all boxes checked)
- Feature is COMPLETE and production-ready

**After S7.P3:** Proceed to S8.P1 to ensure remaining feature specs align with actual implementation.

## Next Phase

**After completing S7.P3 (Final Review):**

- PR review complete (zero critical issues)
- Lessons learned captured and guides updated
- Feature is COMPLETE and production-ready
- Proceed to: `stages/s8/s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md` (Cross-Feature Alignment)
