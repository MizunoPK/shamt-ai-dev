🚨 **MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL**

**Before starting this iteration:**
1. Use Read tool to load THIS ENTIRE GUIDE
2. Verify Iterations 1-3 complete (test strategy, edge cases, config tests planned)
3. Read reference guide: `reference/validation_loop_test_strategy.md`
4. Update feature README.md Agent Status with guide name + timestamp

---

## Overview

**What is this iteration?**
Iteration 4: Validation Loop for test strategy validation.

**Time Estimate:** 15-20 minutes

---

## Quick Start

**What is this iteration?**
S4.I4 validates test strategy completeness using Validation Loop protocol with 3 consecutive clean rounds.

**When do you use this iteration?**
After completing S4.I1, I2, I3 (test coverage matrix, edge cases, config tests all planned)

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ Test strategy validated (3 consecutive clean rounds)
- ✅ test_strategy.md created in feature folder
- ✅ Ready for S5 (Implementation Planning)

**Time Estimate:**
15-20 minutes

---

## Purpose

Validate test strategy completeness using systematic Validation Loop validation from `validation_loop_test_strategy.md`.

**Reference:** `.shamt/guides/reference/validation_loop_test_strategy.md`

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] S4.I1 complete (test coverage matrix created)
- [ ] S4.I2 complete (edge case catalog created)
- [ ] S4.I3 complete (config test matrix created)
- [ ] Test coverage >90% (from I1-I3)
- [ ] Traceability matrix shows 100% requirement coverage

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- ❌ STOP - Do NOT proceed to I4
- Complete missing iterations first

---

## Validation Loop Process

**Follow master protocol:** `validation_loop_master_protocol.md`
**Context-specific guide:** `validation_loop_test_strategy.md`

**Exit Criteria:** 3 consecutive rounds with ZERO issues found

---

## Round 1: Sequential Read + Requirement Coverage Check (5-10 min)

**Pattern:** Read test plan top to bottom, check requirement coverage

**Process:**

1. **Re-read test coverage matrix** (from I1-I3)
2. **Re-read feature spec.md requirements section** with fresh eyes
3. **Check each requirement:**
   - Does this requirement have test coverage?
   - Are tests sufficient (happy path + edge cases + errors)?
   - Is coverage >90% for this requirement?
4. **Check test descriptions:**
   - Are they specific? (not vague like "test login works")
   - Do they have concrete pass/fail criteria?
   - Do they link to requirements?
5. **Document ALL issues found**

**Round 1 Checklist:**

- [ ] Every requirement in spec.md has test coverage
- [ ] All test descriptions are specific and measurable
- [ ] No vague language (concrete pass/fail criteria present)
- [ ] Test plan references requirements explicitly
- [ ] Coverage threshold met (>90% for feature)
- [ ] All edge cases have tests
- [ ] All config scenarios have tests
- [ ] Error paths have tests
- [ ] Integration points have tests
- [ ] Traceability: Each test links to requirement

**If N > 0 issues:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately
- Continue to Round 2

**If N = 0 issues:**
- Proceed to Round 2 anyway (need 3 consecutive clean)
- Increment clean counter: count = 1

---

## Round 2: Edge Case Enumeration + Gap Detection (5-10 min)

**Pattern:** Re-read in different order, focus on gaps and edge cases

**Process:**

1. **Take 2-5 minute break** (clear mental model from Round 1)
2. **Re-read test case list** in different order (by test type, by requirement category, reverse)
3. **Re-read spec.md** with fresh perspective
4. **Ask "what else?":**
   - Are there edge cases I missed?
   - Are there integration points not tested?
   - Are there assumptions that need validation?
   - Are there boundary conditions I didn't consider?
5. **Document ALL issues found**

**Round 2 Checklist:**

- [ ] Re-read spec.md with fresh eyes
- [ ] Any new edge cases discovered?
- [ ] Any new integration points found?
- [ ] Any assumptions needing validation?
- [ ] Coverage gaps identified?
- [ ] Error handling tests comprehensive?
- [ ] Boundary conditions all tested?
- [ ] Config scenarios complete (default, custom, invalid, missing)?

**If N > 0 issues:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately
- Reset counter to 0
- Continue to Round 3

**If N = 0 issues:**
- Proceed to Round 3
- Increment clean counter: count = 2

---

## Round 3: Random Spot-Checks + Integration Verification (5-10 min)

**Pattern:** Random sampling, integration focus, final sweep

**Process:**

1. **Take 2-5 minute break** (fresh perspective)
2. **Random spot-check 5 requirements:**
   - Pick 5 requirements randomly (use: first, middle, last, 2 random)
   - For each: verify test coverage is comprehensive (happy + edge + error)
3. **Integration test verification:**
   - Check all integration points between features have tests
   - Check end-to-end workflow tests present
4. **Final coverage check:**
   - Re-calculate coverage estimate
   - Verify >90% goal met
5. **Document ALL issues found**

**Round 3 Checklist:**

- [ ] Random requirements all have complete coverage (happy + edge + error)
- [ ] Integration tests cover all feature interactions
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests present
- [ ] Error handling tests comprehensive
- [ ] Final coverage estimate >90%
- [ ] No vague test descriptions remain
- [ ] All tests executable (not impossible scenarios)
- [ ] No duplicate test cases

**If N > 0 issues:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately
- Reset counter to 0
- Continue to Round 4

**If N = 0 issues:**
- Increment clean counter: count = 3
- **Check if count >= 3:** YES → PASSED, proceed to create test_strategy.md

---

## Rounds 4+ (If Issues Found in Round 3)

**If issues found in any round:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately
- Reset clean counter to 0
- Continue with next round
- Repeat until 3 consecutive rounds with ZERO issues

**Maximum rounds:** 10 (see `validation_loop_master_protocol.md` for escalation if exceeded)

---

## Exit Criteria

**Can only exit when:**
- [ ] 3 consecutive rounds found ZERO issues each
- [ ] All requirements have test coverage
- [ ] All edge cases tested
- [ ] All integration points tested
- [ ] Coverage >90%
- [ ] All test descriptions specific (not vague)
- [ ] Zero deferred issues
