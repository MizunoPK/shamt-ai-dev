# S1.P3: Discovery Phase Guide

**Guide Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-01-20
**Prerequisites:** S1 Steps 1-2 complete (Initial Setup + Epic Analysis)
**Next Step:** S1 Step 4 (Feature Breakdown Proposal)
**Template:** `templates/discovery_template.md`

---

🚨 **MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL**

**Before starting this guide — including when resuming a prior session:**
1. Use Read tool to load THIS ENTIRE GUIDE
2. Read `reference/validation_loop_discovery.md` to understand Discovery validation loop requirements
3. Verify prerequisites (S1 Steps 1-2 complete, epic folder exists)
4. Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status with guide name + timestamp

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Skip S1.P3.2 (Validation Loop Validation) because the DISCOVERY.md draft "looks complete" — the primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation exit criteria is mandatory
- Proceed to S1 Step 4 (Feature Breakdown Proposal) without completing S1.P3.4 User Approval — user approval is MANDATORY before leaving this phase
- Treat the Discovery Phase as optional for "simple" or "clear" epics — it is mandatory for every epic without exception

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

## Prerequisites

**Before starting S1.P3 (Discovery Phase):**

- [ ] S1 Steps 1-2 complete (Initial Setup + Epic Analysis)
- [ ] Epic folder created with EPIC_README.md
- [ ] Epic request file ({epic_name}_notes.txt) exists and reviewed
- [ ] Initial scope assessment complete (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
- [ ] Working directory: Epic folder root
- [ ] Read validation_loop_discovery.md to understand validation requirements

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- Return to S1 to complete missing steps
- Do NOT start Discovery until Steps 1-2 complete

---

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
The Discovery Phase is a mandatory research and validation process where the agent explores the problem space, creates a comprehensive DISCOVERY.md document, then validates it through Validation Loop protocol until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation confirm completeness.

**When do you use this guide?**
- After completing S1 Step 2 (Epic Analysis)
- Before proposing feature breakdown (S1 Step 4)
- For EVERY epic (mandatory, not optional)

**Key Outputs:**
- DISCOVERY.md created and user-approved
- Problem space thoroughly explored (validated through Validation Loop)
- Solution approach determined
- Scope clearly defined (in/out/deferred)
- Feature breakdown ready to propose

**Time-Box by Epic Size:**
| Epic Size | Discovery Time-Box | Typical Rounds | Time-Box Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|---|---|
| SMALL (1-2 features) | 1-2 hours | 3-5 rounds (incl. primary clean + sub-agents) | 1-2 hours covers: initial research (15-20 min), 2-3 discovery rounds (15-20 min each), sub-agent confirmations (5-10 min). Assumes fewer scope ambiguities. |
| MEDIUM (3-5 features) | 2-3 hours | 4-7 rounds (incl. primary clean + sub-agents) | 2-3 hours covers: initial research (20-30 min), 3-5 discovery rounds (20-30 min each), integration gap resolution (10-15 min), sub-agent confirmations (5-10 min). More features = more integration points. |
| LARGE (6+ features) | 3-4 hours | 6-9 rounds (incl. primary clean + sub-agents) | 3-4 hours covers: extended research (30-45 min), 4-7 discovery rounds (25-35 min each), multiple integration passes, complex dependency verification (15-20 min), sub-agent confirmations (5-10 min). More rounds needed for cross-feature validation. |

**Exit Condition:**
Discovery Phase is complete when Validation Loop validation achieves a primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation (zero issues/gaps), DISCOVERY.md is complete, and user has approved the recommended approach and feature breakdown.

**Validation Loop Reference:** `reference/validation_loop_discovery.md`

**Model Selection for Token Optimization (SHAMT-27):**

Discovery Phase can save 30-40% tokens through delegation:

```
Primary Agent (Opus):
├─ Spawn Haiku → File tree exploration, keyword grep searches, file counting
├─ Spawn Sonnet → Architecture pattern analysis, code convention identification
├─ Primary handles → Problem space synthesis, gap identification, DISCOVERY.md writing
├─ Primary runs → Discovery validation loop (Haiku for confirmations)
```

**See:** `reference/model_selection.md` for Task tool examples.

## Critical Rules

```text
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| CRITICAL RULES - Copy to EPIC_README.md Agent Status        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

1. Discovery Phase is MANDATORY for every epic
   - No exceptions, even for "clear" epics
   - Cannot create feature folders until Discovery completes

2. Discovery uses Validation Loop validation (see validation_loop_discovery.md)
   - Exit criteria: primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation with ZERO issues/gaps
   - Issues/gaps include: Missing research, incomplete sections, unanswered questions,
     assumptions not verified, integration gaps, unclear scope
   - Re-read DISCOVERY.md with fresh perspective each round
   - Fix ALL issues immediately (zero tolerance for deferred issues)

3. All findings and answers go in DISCOVERY.md
   - Single source of truth for epic-level decisions
   - Feature specs will reference this document

4. User answers questions throughout (not just at end)
   - Present questions when they arise during validation rounds
   - Update DISCOVERY.md with answers before continuing

5. DISCOVERY.md becomes reference after approval
   - Only update if something found incorrect/outdated
   - Feature specs reference Discovery for shared context

6. Feature folders NOT created until Discovery approved
   - Discovery informs feature breakdown
   - Cannot know features until Discovery complete
```

## S1.P3.1: Initialize Discovery Document

**Time:** 30-45 minutes (includes initial research)

### Step 1: Create DISCOVERY.md

Create `DISCOVERY.md` in the epic folder using the template.

**Location:** `.shamt/epics/SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/DISCOVERY.md`

**Template:** `templates/discovery_template.md`

### Step 2: Write Epic Request Summary

Summarize what the user requested in 2-4 sentences. Capture the essence without interpretation.

**Example:**
```markdown
## Epic Request Summary

User wants easier test runs for scripts, automated smoke testing,
and "debugging version runs" for league helper modes (4 modes),
processing modules (A and B), and data fetchers (records, metadata,
historical, schedule).

**Original Request:** `improve_debugging_runs_notes.txt`
```

### Step 3: Conduct Initial Research

Research the problem space and document findings in DISCOVERY.md:

**Research activities:**
- Read code/files mentioned in epic request
- Examine existing patterns that could be leveraged
- Identify components affected by the epic
- Note what exists vs what's missing
- Identify solution approaches

**Document findings in DISCOVERY.md sections:**
- Technical Analysis
- Key Findings
- Solution Options (if multiple approaches exist)

### Step 3b: Review Architecture Context

1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
2. Read CODING_STANDARDS.md (if exists)
3. **Check for undocumented additions** (teammate changes, external updates):
   - Compare top-level source directories against ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Check if any new directories/modules exist that aren't documented
   - Check git log since Last Updated for dependency changes
   - Check for significant modules (>5 files or >500 LOC) not mentioned
   - Check for new entry point files not documented
   - If undocumented additions found: note them and plan to update docs during this epic
4. Document in DISCOVERY.md:
   - Which existing components/patterns are relevant
   - Whether this epic might require updates to either file
   - Any inaccuracies or undocumented additions noticed

**Undocumented Additions Quick Check:**

```bash
# Run at start of S1.P3 to detect teammate changes
LAST_UPDATED=$(grep -i "last updated" ARCHITECTURE.md | grep -oE '[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}' | head -1)
echo "ARCHITECTURE.md last updated: $LAST_UPDATED"
echo ""
echo "Source directories not mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.md:"
for dir in src/*/ app/*/ lib/*/; do
  [ -d "$dir" ] && ! grep -qi "$(basename $dir)" ARCHITECTURE.md && echo "  - $dir"
done
echo ""
echo "Commits since last update:"
git log --since="$LAST_UPDATED" --oneline | head -10
```

**Rationale:** Reading these docs during Discovery ensures the agent understands existing architecture before proposing features, surfaces any obvious staleness early, and catches teammate changes that occurred between epics.

### Step 4: Extract Initial Questions

Based on initial research, identify questions that need user input:

**Question sources:**
- Ambiguous language ("easier", "better", "improved")
- Undefined terms ("debugging version run")
- Implicit assumptions that need verification
- Scope boundaries that are unclear
- Multiple valid approaches (need user preference)
- **Implementation approach decisions:** what high-level choices will need to be made? API design, data structures, error handling strategy. Surface these as questions before assuming.
- **Non-functional requirements:** are there performance targets, security constraints, compatibility requirements, or scale expectations?
- **Adjacent systems and side effects:** what else in the codebase could be affected? Are there users or workflows not mentioned in the request that will be impacted?
- **Scope edge cases:** what happens at the boundary of scope? If the user said "add X", what about cases where X partially overlaps with existing Y?
- **Success criteria:** how will the user know this worked? What does the ideal end state look like in concrete terms?

> 🚨 **If you have identified zero questions after reading the entire request:** You are almost certainly under-questioning. Re-read specifically looking for hidden assumptions — things you accepted as true that the user never explicitly stated.

**Document in DISCOVERY.md:** Fill the brainstorm table first, then add questions to the Pending Questions table.

```markdown
### Pending Questions

**Question Brainstorm** — Work through each category before filling the table.

| Category | Questions identified (or justification if none) |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Functional requirements** | What does "debugging version run" mean? |
| **User workflow / edge cases** | What if only some scripts need debug mode? |
| **Implementation approach** | None identified |
| **Constraints** | None identified |
| **Scope boundaries** | Do all 6 scripts need this, or subset? |
| **Success criteria** | How will user verify debug mode works correctly? |

| # | Question | Context | Asked |
|---|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | What does "debugging version run" mean? | Term undefined in request | 2025-01-20 |
| 2 | Should all scripts share the same debug approach? | 6 different scripts mentioned | 2025-01-20 |
```

**Also extract from Discovery Targets:**
Read the "Discovery Targets" section of the epic request. For each target listed, add it to the Pending Questions table with a `[PRIORITY]` tag and `Explicitly requested by user` in the Context column.

```markdown
| # | Question | Context | Asked |
|---|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Is the existing X module extensible? | [PRIORITY] Explicitly requested by user | 2025-01-20 |
```

These take precedence in the Discovery Loop — address them before other open questions.

**Ask user questions before proceeding to Validation Loop**

### Step 5: Set Time-Box

Based on epic size (from S1 Step 2.3), set Discovery time-box:

| Epic Size | Time-Box |
|-----------|----------|
| SMALL (1-2 features) | 1-2 hours |
| MEDIUM (3-5 features) | 2-3 hours |
| LARGE (6+ features) | 3-4 hours |

Document in Discovery Log:
```markdown
## Discovery Log

| Timestamp | Activity | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| 2025-01-20 10:00 | Initialized Discovery | Epic size MEDIUM, time-box 2-3 hours |
| 2025-01-20 10:30 | Initial research complete | Documented findings, identified 3 questions |
| 2025-01-20 10:45 | User answered questions | Clarified approach, ready for validation |
```

### Step 6: Update Agent Status

```markdown
## Agent Status

**Current Phase:** DISCOVERY_PHASE
**Current Step:** S1.P3.1 Complete - Initial Research and DISCOVERY.md Draft
**Current Guide:** stages/s1/s1_p3_discovery_phase.md
**Progress:** DISCOVERY.md drafted, entering Validation Loop validation
**Next Action:** S1.P3.2 - Validation Loop Round 1
```

---

## S1.P3.2: Validation Loop Validation

**Time:** Varies by epic size (bulk of Discovery time)

**Reference:** `reference/validation_loop_discovery.md`

The Validation Loop repeats until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation: primary agent achieves one clean round (zero issues/gaps), then 2 independent sub-agents both confirm zero issues in DISCOVERY.md.

**Clean Round Counter:** Track rounds with zero issues/gaps
- Counter starts at 0
- Increments to 1 when round finds NO issues/gaps (primary clean round achieved)
- Resets to 0 when round finds ANY issues/gaps
- Loop exits when counter = 1 AND both sub-agents confirm zero issues

**Issues/Gaps Include:**
- Missing research or incomplete analysis
- Incomplete sections in DISCOVERY.md
- Unanswered questions or unresolved unknowns
- Unverified assumptions
- Integration gaps or unclear dependencies
- Unclear scope (in/out/deferred not defined)

### Round Structure

Each validation round follows this pattern:

```text
A. Re-read DISCOVERY.md (FRESH PERSPECTIVE each round)
       |
       v
B. Identify Issues/Gaps (check completeness, consistency, clarity)
       |
       v
C. Fix ALL Issues Immediately (zero tolerance for deferred issues)
   - Research missing information
   - Ask user questions if needed
   - Update DISCOVERY.md sections
   - Verify assumptions
   - Clarify scope
       |
       v
D. Check Exit (update clean round counter, check if counter >= 1 → trigger sub-agent confirmation)
```

---

### Step A: Re-read DISCOVERY.md with Fresh Perspective

**CRITICAL: Re-read DISCOVERY.md Completely Each Round**

Each round, you MUST re-read the ENTIRE DISCOVERY.md document. Use different reading patterns:

**Round-Specific Reading Patterns (from validation_loop_discovery.md):**
- **Round 1:** Sequential read (top to bottom), completeness check
- **Round 2:** Reverse order read (bottom to top), consistency check
- **Round 3:** Random section spot-checks, final validation
- **Round 4+:** Thematic clustering (group related sections), cross-reference validation

**Why this matters:** First-pass reading misses 40%+ of important details. Fresh perspective catches what memory-based work misses.

---

### Step B: Identify Issues/Gaps

**Check DISCOVERY.md for these issue categories:**

1. **Missing Research**
   - Incomplete code examination
   - External dependencies not researched
   - Existing patterns not identified
   - Solution approaches not explored

2. **Incomplete Sections**
   - Empty or stub sections in DISCOVERY.md
   - Vague descriptions ("TBD", "will add later")
   - Missing required sections from template

3. **Unanswered Questions**
   - Pending questions not resolved
   - Ambiguous language not clarified
   - Scope boundaries unclear

4. **Unverified Assumptions**
   - Assumptions not checked with user
   - "Probably" or "likely" statements
   - Guesses without verification

5. **Integration Gaps**
   - Unclear how features interact
   - Missing dependency analysis
   - Unclear integration points

6. **Unclear Scope**
   - In/out/deferred not defined
   - Boundaries not documented
   - Feature breakdown rationale missing

**Document all issues found:**
```markdown
## Round {N} Issues Found ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM})

### Issue 1: Missing External Dependencies Research
**Category:** Missing Research
**Description:** Section 3 mentions "API integration" but doesn't specify which API or research alternatives
**Action Required:** Research available external APIs, compare options, ask user preference

### Issue 2: Unverified Assumption
**Category:** Unverified Assumption
**Description:** States "users probably want offline mode" without verification
**Action Required:** Ask user if offline mode is required

[Continue for all issues...]
```

---

### Step C: Fix ALL Issues Immediately

**CRITICAL: Zero Tolerance for Deferred Issues**

For EACH issue identified in Step B, you MUST fix it BEFORE continuing to Step D.

**Fixing strategies by issue type:**

1. **Missing Research** → Research now, document findings
   - Use Grep/Glob to find files
   - Use Read to examine code
   - Document in DISCOVERY.md Technical Analysis

2. **Incomplete Sections** → Complete sections now
   - Fill in TBD markers
   - Add specific details
   - Remove vague placeholders

3. **Unanswered Questions** → Ask user now, record answers
   - Present questions to user
   - Wait for answers
   - Update DISCOVERY.md with answers

4. **Unverified Assumptions** → Verify now
   - Ask user to confirm/reject assumption
   - Replace "probably" with confirmed answer
   - Document verification in Resolved Questions

5. **Integration Gaps** → Analyze now
   - Identify integration points
   - Document dependencies
   - Clarify data flow

6. **Unclear Scope** → Define now
   - Explicitly list in/out/deferred
   - Document rationale for boundaries
   - Get user confirmation if needed

**Update DISCOVERY.md with fixes:**
```markdown
## Round {N} Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: External Dependencies Researched
**Issue:** Missing API research
**Resolution:** Researched primary API (free, reliable) and secondary API (better data). Asked user, user prefers primary API.
**Updated Section:** Technical Analysis - External Dependencies

### Fix 2: Verified Offline Requirement
**Issue:** Unverified offline assumption
**Resolution:** Asked user, confirmed offline mode NOT required (API calls acceptable)
**Updated Section:** Resolved Questions #5

[Continue for all fixes...]
```

---

### Step D: Check Exit Condition

**Update Clean Round Counter:**

1. **Check this round:** Were ANY issues/gaps found in Step B?
   - **YES (issues found):** Counter = 0 (reset after fixing all), continue loop
   - **NO (zero issues):** Counter = 1 (primary clean round achieved) → trigger sub-agent confirmation

2. **Trigger sub-agent confirmation:** Spawn 2 independent sub-agents in parallel; both must confirm zero issues to exit.
   - Both confirm zero issues → verify exit readiness checklist below
   - Either sub-agent finds issues → Counter resets to 0, continue loop

3. **Exit verification checklist (after sub-agent confirmation):**
   ```markdown
   ## Validation Loop Exit Verification (After Primary Clean + Sub-Agent Confirmation)

   [ ] Primary clean round achieved + both sub-agents confirmed zero issues/gaps
   [ ] All sections of DISCOVERY.md complete
   [ ] All pending questions resolved
   [ ] All assumptions verified
   [ ] Scope clearly defined (in/out/deferred documented)
   [ ] Solution approach identified with rationale
   [ ] Feature breakdown ready with Discovery basis
   [ ] All [PRIORITY] Discovery Targets from epic request resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale

   If any unchecked --> Reset counter to 0, continue loop
   If all checked --> Proceed to S1.P3.3 Synthesis
   ```

**Document round in DISCOVERY.md:**
```markdown
## Validation Loop Round {N} ({YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM})

**Reading Pattern:** {Sequential | Reverse | Random spot-check | Thematic clustering}
**Issues Found:** {Number}
**Clean Round Counter:** {0 = issues found; 1 = primary clean → trigger sub-agents}

[Issues and fixes documented above...]
```

**Why primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation:**
- Primary clean round: main agent declares complete with zero issues
- Sub-agent A confirms: independent fresh-eyes check confirms zero issues
- Sub-agent B confirms: second independent check confirms zero issues

**Continue loop (counter = 0 OR sub-agents found issues) if:**
- ANY issues/gaps found (reset counter after fixing)
- Either sub-agent found issues in confirmation step
- Exit verification checklist has unchecked items

**Exit loop (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation) when:**
- Primary agent found ZERO issues/gaps this round
- Both sub-agents independently confirmed zero issues
- Exit verification checklist all checked

---

## S1.P3.3: Synthesize Findings

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

After the Discovery Loop exits, compile findings into actionable recommendations.

### Step 0: Check Approaches to Avoid

Before listing options, read the "Approaches to Avoid" section of the epic request. Document what's already been ruled out:

```markdown
### Ruled Out (from epic request)
- {approach}: {reason given by user}
```

For each solution option you're considering, confirm it doesn't repeat a rejected pattern. If it does, either eliminate it or document why the constraint doesn't apply in this specific context.

### Step 1: Document Solution Options

For each approach identified during research:

```markdown
## Solution Options

### Option 1: CLI Flags Per Script

**Description:** Add --debug flag to each script that enables reduced iterations and verbose logging.

**Pros:**
- Simple, familiar pattern
- Per-script control
- No new dependencies

**Cons:**
- Must update each script individually
- No centralized configuration

**Effort Estimate:** MEDIUM

**Fit Assessment:** Good - matches user's CLI preference

### Option 2: Shared Debug Configuration

**Description:** Central debug config in shared_config.py, read by all scripts.

**Pros:**
- Single place to configure
- Consistent behavior

**Cons:**
- Less per-script flexibility
- Must modify config loading

**Effort Estimate:** MEDIUM

**Fit Assessment:** Good - supports override requirement
```

### Step 2: Create Comparison Summary

```markdown
### Option Comparison Summary

| Option | Effort | Fit | Recommended |
|--------|--------|-----|-------------|
| CLI Flags Per Script | MEDIUM | GOOD | YES (combined) |
| Shared Debug Config | MEDIUM | GOOD | YES (combined) |
| Separate Test Scripts | HIGH | POOR | NO |
```

### Step 3: Document Recommended Approach

## Recommended Approach

**Recommendation:** Combined CLI flags + shared config

**Rationale:**
- User prefers CLI flags (Q2 answer)
- User wants config override capability (Q2 answer)
- Existing verbose logging can be leveraged (Iteration 1 finding)
- Pattern is consistent with codebase conventions (Iteration 2 finding)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- --debug flag on each script: Triggers debug mode
- Shared config for defaults: debug_iterations=1, debug_verbose=True
- Per-script override: Scripts can customize debug behavior
```

### Step 4: Define Scope

```markdown
## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- --debug CLI flag for all 6 script types
- Shared debug configuration
- Reduced iterations (default: 1)
- Verbose logging enabled

### Out of Scope
- Mock data support - deferred to future epic
- GUI/interactive debug mode - not requested
- Automated test framework - separate concern

### Deferred (Future Work)
- Mock data option - nice-to-have, revisit after core debug works
```

### Step 5: Draft Feature Breakdown

```markdown
## Proposed Feature Breakdown

**Total Features:** 4
**Implementation Order:** Sequential (Feature 1 first, then 2-4 can parallel)

### Feature 1: debug_infrastructure

**Purpose:** Shared debug configuration and utilities used by all scripts

**Scope:**
- Debug configuration in shared_config.py
- Verbose logging setup for debug mode
- Common debug utilities

**Dependencies:** None (foundation feature)

**Discovery Basis:**
- Based on Finding: Existing verbose logging in utils/ (Iteration 1)
- Based on User Answer: Shared config with per-script override (Q5)

**Estimated Size:** SMALL

### Feature 2: [module]_debug

**Purpose:** Debug mode for all 4 league helper modes

**Scope:**
- --debug flag for run_[module].py
- Debug behavior for draft, optimizer, trade, data editor modes
- Integration with debug infrastructure

**Dependencies:** Feature 1 (debug_infrastructure)

**Discovery Basis:**
- Based on Finding: Uses argparse with mode selection (Iteration 1)
- Based on User Answer: All 4 modes need debug support (Q2)

**Estimated Size:** MEDIUM

### Feature 3: processing_debug

**Purpose:** Debug mode for core processing modules

**Scope:**
- --debug flag for [run_script].py
- Reduced iterations for processing-heavy modules
- Verbose output during processing

**Dependencies:** Feature 1 (debug_infrastructure)

**Discovery Basis:**
- Based on Finding: Has --iterations flag already (Iteration 1)
- Based on User Answer: 1 iteration default, configurable (Q4)

**Estimated Size:** SMALL

### Feature 4: fetcher_debug

**Purpose:** Debug mode for all data fetcher scripts

**Scope:**
- --debug flag for records, metadata, historical, schedule fetchers
- Reduced data fetching in debug mode
- Verbose logging

**Dependencies:** Feature 1 (debug_infrastructure)

**Discovery Basis:**
- Based on Finding: Similar patterns across fetchers (Iteration 2)
- Based on User Answer: Same approach for all fetchers (Q5)

**Estimated Size:** MEDIUM
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```text
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| "If You're Thinking This, STOP" - Anti-Pattern Detection   |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

X "This epic seems clear, I'll skip Discovery"
  --> STOP - Discovery is MANDATORY for every epic

X "I'll defer these issues and fix them later"
  --> STOP - Validation Loop has ZERO TOLERANCE for deferred issues

X "I know the answer, don't need to ask user"
  --> STOP - User answers all scope/preference/assumption questions

X "I'll create feature folders now and update Discovery later"
  --> STOP - Feature folders created AFTER Discovery approval

X "No issues found, but I haven't checked assumptions"
  --> STOP - Assumptions count as issues until verified

X "User approved, but I want to add one more feature"
  --> STOP - Feature breakdown is what user approved

X "I'll update DISCOVERY.md later with fixes"
  --> STOP - Fix ALL issues immediately in current round

X "One clean round with no issues, I'm done with Discovery without sub-agent confirmation"
  --> STOP - After achieving a primary clean round (counter = 1), you MUST trigger sub-agent confirmation: spawn 2 sub-agents in parallel, both must confirm zero issues to exit

X "I've re-read DISCOVERY.md before, I'll skip re-reading"
  --> STOP - MUST re-read completely with fresh perspective each round

X "Counter is at 2, close enough to 3"
  --> STOP - Must reach exactly 3, no rounding

X "This section is 'good enough', I'll mark it complete"
  --> STOP - Good enough = incomplete = issue found = counter reset

X "I found 5 issues, I'll fix 3 now and 2 later"
  --> STOP - Fix ALL issues before proceeding (zero deferred issues)

X "I'll create a documentation feature to update README/ARCHITECTURE"
  --> STOP - Documentation is handled in S7.P3 (per-feature) and S10 (epic-level), NOT as separate feature
  --> EXCEPTION: Only create documentation feature if user EXPLICITLY requests it

X "I read the entire epic request and have no questions for the user"
  --> STOP - Zero initial questions is a red flag.
  --> Re-read with the question brainstorm categories in mind (functional
      requirements, user workflow/edge cases, implementation approach,
      constraints, scope boundaries, success criteria).
```

## Re-Reading Checkpoints

## 🛑 MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 1

**You have completed S1.P3.1 (Initialize)**

⚠️ STOP - DO NOT PROCEED TO S1.P3.2 YET

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read "Critical Rules" section of this guide
2. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read `reference/validation_loop_discovery.md` (context variant)
3. [ ] Verify DISCOVERY.md created with initial research documented
4. [ ] Verify at least one clarifying question was asked of and answered by the user. If no questions were generated, STOP. Re-read the request using the question brainstorm categories before proceeding.
4b. [ ] Verified that question brainstorm categories were worked through (all 6 categories in DISCOVERY.md have either questions listed or an explicit one-line justification for why none apply).
5. [ ] Verify time-box set based on epic size (SMALL: 1-2hrs, MEDIUM: 2-3hrs, LARGE: 3-4hrs)
6. [ ] Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status:
   - Current Step: "S1.P3.1 complete, starting S1.P3.2 Validation Loop Round 1"
   - Last Updated: [timestamp]
7. [ ] Output acknowledgment: "✅ CHECKPOINT 1 COMPLETE: Re-read Critical Rules and validation_loop_discovery.md, verified DISCOVERY.md drafted"

**Why this checkpoint exists:**
- Critical Rules define Validation Loop exit condition (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
- validation_loop_discovery.md defines reading patterns and issue categories
- 80% of agents forget to re-read with fresh perspective each round
- 30 seconds now prevents hours of wasted validation rounds

**ONLY after completing ALL 7 actions above, proceed to S1.P3.2 (Validation Loop)**

---

## 🛑 MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 2

**You have completed one Validation Loop round**

⚠️ STOP - DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT ROUND YET

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read "Validation Loop Validation" section of this guide
2. [ ] Verify all issues/gaps documented in DISCOVERY.md
3. [ ] Verify ALL issues/gaps fixed (not deferred) - zero tolerance policy
4. [ ] Update clean round counter:
   - Issues/gaps found? → Counter = 0 (reset after fixing all)
   - Zero issues/gaps? → Counter++
5. [ ] Check counter value: Counter < 1 = continue loop, Counter = 1 = trigger sub-agent confirmation → verify exit readiness
6. [ ] Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status:
   - Current Step: "S1.P3.2 Round N complete, `consecutive_clean` = {X}, [continuing loop OR triggering sub-agent confirmation OR proceeding to S1.P3.3]"
   - Last Updated: [timestamp]
7. [ ] Output acknowledgment: "✅ CHECKPOINT 2 COMPLETE: Re-read Validation Loop section, verified all issues fixed, counter = {X}"

**Why this checkpoint exists:**
- Validation Loop requires primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation
- 75% of agents exit after first clean round without triggering sub-agent confirmation (premature)
- 60% of agents defer issues instead of fixing immediately
- Premature exit or deferred issues cause incomplete discovery and rework in S2

**ONLY after completing ALL 7 actions above, proceed to next round OR S1.P3.3**

---

## 🛑 MANDATORY CHECKPOINT 3

**You are about to request User Approval (S1.P3.4)**

⚠️ STOP - DO NOT PROCEED TO S1.P3.4 YET

**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. [ ] Use Read tool to re-read "Synthesize Findings" section of this guide
2. [ ] Verify Validation Loop exited cleanly (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation, zero issues)
3. [ ] Verify all sections of DISCOVERY.md complete:
   - [ ] Executive Summary
   - [ ] Key Findings
   - [ ] Technical Analysis
   - [ ] Solution Options with comparison
   - [ ] Recommended Approach with rationale
   - [ ] Scope Definition (in/out/deferred)
   - [ ] Recommended Feature Breakdown
   - [ ] All Open Questions resolved
4. [ ] Verify feature breakdown has Discovery basis for each feature
5. [ ] Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status:
   - Current Step: "S1.P3.3 complete, requesting user approval in S1.P3.4"
   - Last Updated: [timestamp]
6. [ ] Output acknowledgment: "✅ CHECKPOINT 3 COMPLETE: Re-read Synthesize section, verified Validation Loop exited cleanly, DISCOVERY.md complete"

**Why this checkpoint exists:**
- DISCOVERY.md must be complete before user approval
- Validation Loop must exit cleanly (not prematurely)
- 90% of agents miss at least one required section
- Incomplete DISCOVERY causes user confusion and delays approval

**ONLY after completing ALL 6 actions above, proceed to S1.P3.4 (User Approval)**

---
