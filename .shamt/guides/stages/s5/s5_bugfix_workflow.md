## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL

**BEFORE creating a bug fix, you MUST:**

1. **Use the phase transition prompt** from `prompts_reference_v2.md`
   - Find "Creating Bug Fix" prompt
   - Speak it out loud (acknowledge requirements)

2. **Update README Agent Status** with:
   - Current Phase: BUG_FIX_CREATION
   - Current Guide: stages/s5/s5_bugfix_workflow.md
   - Guide Last Read: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
   - Critical Rules: "Get user approval first", "Create notes.txt", "Update epic docs"
   - Next Action: Create bugfix_{priority}_{name} folder

3. **Get user approval** before creating bug fix folder

4. **THEN AND ONLY THEN** proceed with bug fix creation

---

## Prerequisites

**Before starting bug fix workflow:**

- [ ] Bug or missing scope discovered during S5 (implementation) OR reported by user
- [ ] Bug is clearly defined (not a vague issue)
- [ ] Epic is in progress (has active feature work)
- [ ] Read prompts_reference_v2.md "Creating Bug Fix" prompt
- [ ] Working directory: Epic folder root

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- Define bug clearly before proceeding
- If not during epic work, use standard feature workflow instead

---

## Overview

**What is this guide?**
Bug Fix Workflow is a streamlined process for handling bugs discovered during epic implementation, using a simplified workflow (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7) that skips epic-level stages while maintaining full rigor for quality.

**When do you use this guide?**
- Bug discovered during S5 (feature implementation) or reported by user
- Need to fix bug without disrupting epic progress
- Ready to create focused bug fix

**Key Outputs:**
- ✅ bugfix_{priority}_{name} folder created inside epic folder
- ✅ notes.txt created and user-verified
- ✅ Bug fix implemented through simplified workflow (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)
- ✅ Epic documentation updated for resumability
- ✅ Ready to resume previous work

**Time Estimate:**
Varies by bug complexity (30 minutes to 2 hours typical)

**Exit Condition:**
Bug Fix is complete when the bug is fixed through the full workflow (including complete S5 v2 Validation Loop and QC rounds), bug fix folder remains in epic directory, and epic README documents where to resume previous work

---

## 🛑 Critical Rules

```text
1. ⚠️ GET USER APPROVAL FIRST
   - Don't automatically create bug fix
   - Present issue to user
   - Ask: "Should I create bug fix or continue?"
   - User decides priority level

2. ⚠️ CREATE NOTES.TXT (User verifies)
   - Agent writes initial notes.txt
   - User reviews and updates if needed
   - User approval required before proceeding

3. ⚠️ UPDATE EPIC DOCS FOR RESUMABILITY
   - Document current work state before switching
   - Update epic README with bug fix status
   - Add to Bug Fix Tracking table
   - Future agent must know where to resume

4. ⚠️ FOLLOW SIMPLIFIED WORKFLOW
   - Bug fixes: S2 → S5 → S6 → S7
   - SKIP: Stages 1, 3, 4, S8, S9, S10
   - Same rigor as features (S5 v2 Validation Loop, QC rounds)
   - No shortcuts

5. ⚠️ PRIORITY DETERMINES INTERRUPTION
   - high: Interrupt immediately
   - medium: Finish current sub-stage first
   - low: Finish current feature first

6. ⚠️ BUG FIX STAYS IN EPIC FOLDER
   - Don't move to done/ until epic completes
   - Easier for epic-level QC
   - All epic work stays together

7. ⚠️ RETURN TO PREVIOUS WORK AFTER COMPLETION
   - Bug fix folder stays in epic directory
   - README Agent Status shows where to resume
   - Continue epic from where it left off
```

---

## PHASE 1: Bug Fix Creation

### Step 1: Discover Issue

**Trigger scenarios:**
- QC round finds critical bug in just-completed feature
- User reports issue with existing feature
- Agent discovers missing scope during implementation
- Integration testing reveals conflict between features

---

### Step 2: Present to User

**Template:**
```markdown
I've discovered an issue that needs addressing:

## Issue: {Brief description}

**Discovered during:** {Stage and feature}

**Problem:**
{Clear description of what's wrong}

**Impact:**
{What doesn't work because of this}

**Recommendation:**
Create bug fix with priority: {high/medium/low}

**Proposed priority reasoning:**
- high: {Blocks current work / Critical functionality broken}
- medium: {Non-blocking but important / Affects user experience}
- low: {Minor issue / Can wait until after current feature}

Should I:
1. Create bug fix now (interrupts current work)
2. Document issue and continue (address later)
3. Other approach

What would you like to do?
```

**Wait for user response**

---

### Step 3: Create Bug Fix Folder

**If user approves:**

1. **Determine folder name:**
   ```text
   bugfix_{priority}_{short_name}/

   Examples:
   - bugfix_high_authentication_error/
   - bugfix_medium_missing_rank_multiplier/
   - bugfix_low_typo_in_logs/
   ```

2. **Create folder in epic directory:**
   ```text
   .shamt/epics/SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/bugfix_{priority}_{name}/
   ```

3. **Create initial structure:**
   ```text
   bugfix_{priority}_{name}/
   ├── notes.txt        (create now - user verifies)
   ├── spec.md          (create in S2)
   ├── checklist.md     (create in S2)
   ├── implementation_plan.md (create in S5)
   ├── implementation_checklist.md (create in S6)
   └── lessons_learned.md (create in S7 (Testing & Review))
   ```

---

### Step 4: Create notes.txt

**Template:**
```text
BUG FIX: {name}
Priority: {high/medium/low}
Discovered: {date}
Discovered During: {Stage X - feature_name}

----

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:

{Clear description of the bug/issue}

What's wrong:
- {Symptom 1}
- {Symptom 2}
- {Symptom 3}

How discovered:
- {How the issue was found - e.g., "Validation Loop revealed...", "User reported..."}

Impact:
- {What doesn't work because of this bug}
- {Who is affected}
- {How severe}

----

ROOT CAUSE (if known):

{Analysis of why the bug exists}

Example:
- Missing null check in ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier()
- When item has no rank data, method crashes instead of returning default

----

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

{How to fix it}

Example:
- Add null check at top of method
- Return (1.0, 50) for null/missing rank (neutral multiplier)
- Add unit test for null rank case

----

VERIFICATION PLAN:

How to verify fix works:
1. {Test scenario 1}
2. {Test scenario 2}
3. {Expected result}

----

USER NOTES:

{User can add notes, clarifications, or corrections here}
```

---

### Step 5: User Verification

**Actions:**
1. Save notes.txt
2. Ask user to review and update notes.txt
3. Wait for user approval

**Template:**
```text
I've created bugfix_{priority}_{name}/notes.txt with the issue description.

Please review and update if needed:
- Is the problem description accurate?
- Is the root cause correct?
- Is the proposed solution appropriate?
- Anything to add or clarify?

Once you've reviewed, let me know and I'll proceed with the bug fix workflow.
```

---

### Step 6: Update Epic Documentation

**Update EPIC_README.md:**

**Add to Bug Fix Tracking table:**
```markdown
### Bug Fix Tracking

| # | Bug Fix Name | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|--------------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | bugfix_high_authentication_error | high | S2 | Discovered during feature_01 QC |
```

**Add to Current Status section:**
```markdown
### Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-30 18:00

**Active Bug Fixes:**
- bugfix_high_authentication_error (S2 - Deep Dive)
  - Discovered: During feature_01 Validation Loop
  - Priority: high (blocks feature_02 implementation)
  - Currently: Creating spec.md for bug fix

**Paused Work:**
- feature_01_rank_integration: Paused at S7 (Testing & Review) (post-implementation)
  - Resume point: After bug fix complete, verify fix doesn't affect feature_01
  - Agent Status saved: README.md in feature_01/ folder
```

---

### Step 7: Save Current Work State

**Update current feature's README.md:**

```markdown
### Agent Status (PAUSED - Bug Fix in Progress)

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-30 18:00
**Status:** PAUSED for bugfix_high_authentication_error
**Paused At:** S7 (Testing & Review) - Validation Loop (found bug, creating fix)

**Resume Instructions:**
When bug fix complete:
1. Re-run S7 (Testing & Review) Validation Loop (verify bug fix didn't affect this feature)
2. If passes: Continue to Final Review (S7.P3)
3. If fails: Investigate interaction with bug fix

**Context at Pause:**
- Validation Loop in progress - found authentication bug that affects this feature
- Bug discovered: ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier() crashes on null rank
- This feature calls get_rank_multiplier() - need to verify fix works correctly
```

---

## PHASE 2: Bug Fix Implementation

**Bug fixes follow SIMPLIFIED workflow:**

```text
S2 (Deep Dive) →
S5 (Implementation Planning) →
S6 (Implementation) →
S7 (Testing & Review) (Post-Implementation) →
DONE (return to previous work)
```

**SKIP these stages:**
- ❌ S1 (Epic Planning) - epic already planned
- ❌ S3 (Cross-Feature Sanity Check) - not needed for single bug
- ❌ S4 (Feature Testing Strategy) - not needed for single bug
- ❌ S8.P1 - bug fix doesn't affect other specs
- ❌ S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update) (Epic Testing Plan Update) - handled in S7 (Testing & Review)
- ❌ S9 (Epic Final QC) - bug fix has own QC in S7 (Testing & Review)
- ❌ S10 (Epic Cleanup) - bug stays with epic

---

### S2: Deep Dive (Adapted for Bug Fixes)

**Read:** stages/s2/s2_feature_deep_dive.md

**Adapt for bug fix:**
1. **Create spec.md** (bug fix requirements)
   - What needs to be fixed
   - Root cause analysis
   - Solution approach
   - Verification plan

2. **Create checklist.md** (decisions for bug fix)
   - Usually shorter than feature checklists
   - Focus on fix approach decisions

3. **Create lessons_learned.md** (why bug happened, how to prevent)

4. **Skip:** Cross-feature alignment (not needed for bug)

**Keep spec.md focused:**
```markdown
## Bug Fix: Authentication Error

### Root Cause

ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier() crashes when item has null rank value.

Location: [module]/util/ConfigManager.py:234

```
def get_rank_multiplier(self, rank_value: float) -> Tuple[float, int]:
    # BUG: No null check
    if rank_value < 10:  # Crashes if rank_value is None
        return (1.50, 100)
```markdown

### Solution

Add null check at method start:

```
def get_rank_multiplier(self, rank_value: float) -> Tuple[float, int]:
    # FIX: Handle null/missing rank
    if rank_value is None:
        self.logger.info("rank value missing, using neutral multiplier")
        return (1.0, 50)

    if rank_value < 10:
        return (1.50, 100)
```markdown

### Testing

Unit tests:
- test_get_rank_multiplier_with_none()
- test_get_rank_multiplier_with_zero()

Integration test:
- Verify RecordManager handles None rank priority gracefully
```

---

### S5: Implementation Planning

**Guide:** `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md` (comprehensive)

**Process:**
1. Phase 1: Draft Creation (30-60 min for bug fixes)
2. Phase 2: Validation Loop (2-4 hours, typically 4-6 rounds)

**Same rigor as features:**
- Complete validation across all 11 dimensions
- Algorithm Traceability (Dimension 3)
- Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation (Dimension 11, includes Gates 23a, 25)
- Exit with 3 consecutive clean validation rounds

**Bug fix TODOs usually shorter:**
```markdown
## Bug Fix TODO: Authentication Error

### Phase 1: Fix Implementation
- [ ] Add null check to ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier()
- [ ] Add logging for missing rank case
- [ ] Update method docstring

### Phase 2: Testing
- [ ] Add unit test: test_get_rank_multiplier_with_none()
- [ ] Add unit test: test_get_rank_multiplier_with_zero()
- [ ] Run all ConfigManager tests (verify no regressions)

## Phase 3: Integration Verification
- [ ] Test RecordManager with None rank priority
- [ ] Verify feature_01 still works after fix
- [ ] Run full test suite (100% pass required)

## Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Update implementation_checklist.md
```

---

### S6: Implementation

**Read:** stages/s6/s6_execution.md

**Same process as features:**
- Interface Verification Protocol
- Keep spec.md visible
- Phase-by-phase implementation
- Run tests after each step
- Update implementation_checklist.md

---

### S7 (Testing & Review): Post-Implementation

**Read guides in order:**
1. stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md - Smoke Testing (3 parts - MANDATORY GATE)
2. stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md - Validation Loop (3 consecutive clean rounds)
3. stages/s7/s7_p3_final_review.md - PR Review (11 categories) + lessons learned

**Same validation as features:**
- Smoke Testing (3 parts)
- Validation Loop (3 consecutive clean rounds)
- PR Review (11 categories)
- Fix-and-continue approach if issues found

**Bug fix smoke testing:**
```bash
## Part 1: Import test
python -c "from [module].util.ConfigManager import ConfigManager"

## Part 2: Entry point test (if applicable)
python run_[module].py --help

## Part 3: E2E test
## Run scenario that triggered bug
## Verify bug no longer occurs
python run_[module].py --mode draft
## Check: Items with missing rank work correctly
```

---

## PHASE 3: Resume Previous Work

### Step 1: Mark Bug Fix Complete

**Update EPIC_README.md:**

```markdown
### Bug Fix Tracking

| # | Bug Fix Name | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|--------------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | bugfix_high_authentication_error | high | COMPLETE | Fixed null rank handling |

### Current Status

**Completed Bug Fixes:**
- bugfix_high_authentication_error:
  - Completed: 2025-12-30 19:00
  - Solution: Added null check to ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier()
  - Verification: All tests pass, feature_01 retested successfully

**Resuming Work:**
- feature_01_rank_integration: Resuming S7 (Testing & Review) (post-implementation)
  - Resume from: Validation Loop (re-run after bug fix)
  - Next action: Complete Validation Loop (3 consecutive clean rounds)
```

---

### Step 2: Verify Bug Fix Doesn't Affect Paused Work

**Check:**
- Does bug fix change interfaces paused feature uses?
- Does bug fix affect data structures paused feature depends on?
- Does bug fix require retesting paused feature?

**Example:**
```bash
Bug fix: Added null check to ConfigManager.get_rank_multiplier()

Paused feature: feature_01_rank_integration

Impact check:
- feature_01 calls get_rank_multiplier() → AFFECTED
- Need to re-run feature_01's QC to verify fix didn't break it

Action: Re-run feature_01 S7 (Testing & Review) Validation Loop before continuing
```

---

### Step 3: Resume from Saved State

**Read paused feature's README.md:**
```markdown
### Agent Status (PAUSED - Bug Fix in Progress)

**Resume Instructions:**
When bug fix complete:
1. Re-run S7 (Testing & Review) Validation Loop (verify bug fix didn't affect this feature)
2. If passes: Continue to Final Review (S7.P3)
3. If fails: Investigate interaction with bug fix
```

**Follow resume instructions explicitly**

---

### Step 4: Update README Agent Status

```markdown
**Current Phase:** POST_IMPLEMENTATION_VALIDATION_LOOP (Resumed)
**Current Guide:** stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md
**Guide Last Read:** 2025-12-30 19:15
**Resumed After:** bugfix_high_authentication_error completion
**Next Action:** Re-run Validation Loop to verify bug fix compatibility
```

---

## Priority Handling

### High Priority

**When:** Bug blocks current work or breaks critical functionality

**Action:** Interrupt immediately

**Example:**
```text
Currently: feature_01 S6 (implementation)
Bug discovered: ConfigManager crashes (blocks feature_01)
Priority: high

Action:
1. Save feature_01 state (update README)
2. Create bug fix immediately
3. Complete bug fix (S2 → S7)
4. Resume feature_01 S6
```

---

### Medium Priority

**When:** Bug doesn't block but affects user experience

**Action:** Finish current sub-stage, then switch

**Example:**
```text
Currently: feature_02 S6 Phase 2 (of 4 phases)
Bug discovered: Log messages unclear
Priority: medium

Action:
1. Complete Phase 2
2. Save feature_02 state (at end of Phase 2)
3. Create and fix bug
4. Resume feature_02 Phase 3
```

---

### Low Priority

**When:** Minor issue that can wait

**Action:** Finish current feature, then switch

**Example:**
```text
Currently: feature_03 S7 (Testing & Review) (Validation Loop)
Bug discovered: Typo in output message
Priority: low

Action:
1. Complete feature_03 through S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update)
2. Then create and fix bug
3. Continue to next feature
```

---

## Completion Criteria

**Bug fix is complete when:**

- [x] notes.txt created and user-verified
- [x] spec.md created (root cause, solution)
- [x] checklist.md created
- [x] S5 v2 complete (Validation Loop passed, implementation_plan.md)
- [x] S6 complete (implementation, tests pass)
- [x] S7 (Testing & Review) complete (smoke tests, QC rounds, PR review)
- [x] lessons_learned.md updated
- [x] Epic README updated (bug fix marked complete)
- [x] Previous work verified compatible with fix
- [x] Ready to resume previous work

---

## Common Mistakes

### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping User Approval

**Mistake:** Agent discovers bug and immediately creates bug fix folder

**Why wrong:** User should decide priority and whether to fix now

**Correct:** Present issue, get approval, then create folder

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Shortcuts in Bug Fix QC

**Mistake:** "It's just a small bug, I'll skip QC rounds"

**Why wrong:** Small bugs can have big impacts. Same rigor required.

**Correct:** Full S7 (Testing & Review) validation (smoke tests + Validation Loop (3 consecutive clean rounds) + PR review)

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Not Updating Epic Docs

**Mistake:** Create bug fix but don't update EPIC_README or feature README

**Why wrong:** Future agent won't know bug fix exists or where to resume

**Correct:** Update both epic README and paused feature's README

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Forgetting to Resume

**Mistake:** Complete bug fix, then start new work without resuming paused feature

**Why wrong:** Paused feature left incomplete

**Correct:** Resume paused work, verify compatibility, complete paused feature

---

## Exit Criteria

**Bug fix workflow is complete when ALL of these are true:**

- [ ] User approved bug fix creation (priority and timing decided)
- [ ] bugfix_{priority}_{name}/ folder created with complete structure
- [ ] notes.txt created and user-verified
- [ ] Bug fix workflow followed (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7 with full rigor)
- [ ] Complete Validation Loop in S5 v2 (all 11 dimensions, 3 clean rounds, no shortcuts)
- [ ] QC rounds passed (S7)
- [ ] Bug fix tested and verified
- [ ] Epic documentation updated for resumability
- [ ] Paused work resumed cleanly with compatibility verification
- [ ] Bug fix remains in epic folder (not moved to done/)

**If any criterion unchecked:** Complete missing items before considering bug fix done

---

## Summary

**Bug fix workflow ensures bugs are fixed properly without disrupting epic progress:**

1. **Get approval** - User decides priority and timing
2. **Document thoroughly** - notes.txt user-verified
3. **Follow simplified workflow** - S2 → S5 → S6 → S7
4. **Same rigor** - S5 v2 Validation Loop (11 dimensions, 3 clean rounds), QC rounds, no shortcuts
5. **Resume cleanly** - Return to paused work, verify compatibility

**Critical:**
- Bug fixes stay in epic folder (don't move to done/)
- Same validation rigor as features
- Priority determines interruption timing
- Epic docs updated for resumability

---

## Next Phase

**After completing bug fix workflow (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7 complete):**

- Bug fix validated and user-confirmed
- Proceed to: `stages/s6/s6_execution.md` (if returning to interrupted feature)
- OR return to wherever the epic was paused (see EPIC_README.md Agent Status)

**See also:** `prompts_reference_v2.md` → "Resuming In-Progress Epic" prompt
