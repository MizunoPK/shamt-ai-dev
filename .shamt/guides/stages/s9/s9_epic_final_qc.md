# S9: Epic-Level Final QC Guide (ROUTER)

🚨 **IMPORTANT: This guide has been split into focused sub-stages**

**This is a routing guide.** The complete S9 workflow is now split across four focused guides:

- **S9.P1**: Epic Smoke Testing
- **S9.P2**: Epic QC Validation Loop
- **S9.P3**: User Testing
- **S9.P4**: Epic Final Review

**📖 Read the appropriate sub-stage guide based on your current step.**

## Prerequisites

**Before starting S9:**

- [ ] ALL features completed through S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update)
- [ ] All feature-level testing passed (S7 complete for all features)
- [ ] All features committed to git branch
- [ ] epic_smoke_test_plan.md updated with latest version (from S8.P2)
- [ ] No pending bug fixes or debugging sessions
- [ ] EPIC_README.md Feature Tracking shows all features with S8.P2 checked

**If any prerequisite fails:**
- Return to incomplete features and finish S7-S8
- Do NOT start S9 until ALL features are fully complete

---

## Quick Navigation

**Use this table to find the right guide:**

| Current Phase | Guide to Read | Time Estimate |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Starting S9 | `stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md` | 60-90 min |
| S9.P1: Epic Smoke Testing | `stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md` | 45-75 min |
| S9.P2: Validation Loop | `stages/s9/s9_p2_epic_qc_rounds.md` | 2-4 hours |
| S9.P3: User Testing | `stages/s9/s9_p3_user_testing.md` | Variable |
| S9.P4: Epic Final Review | `stages/s9/s9_p4_epic_final_review.md` | 1.5-2 hours |

### Single-Feature Epic Shortcut

**If the epic has exactly 1 feature AND no cross-feature integration exists:**

> Skip S9.P1 and S9.P2. Proceed directly to **S9.P3 (User Testing)**.

**Why:** S9.P1 and S9.P2 are redundant for single-feature epics:
- Code has not changed since S7 (no new integration to verify)
- S9.P1 would re-run the same smoke test as S7.P1
- S9.P2 would re-run the same QC loop as S7.P2
- Part 4 (cross-feature integration) is N/A by definition

**S9.P3 remains mandatory** — user testing is the genuine value-add of S9 and cannot be replicated by the agent, regardless of feature count.

**Apply this shortcut ONLY when:**
- ✅ Epic has exactly 1 feature
- ✅ No cross-feature workflows to verify

**Do NOT skip S9.P1 and S9.P2 when:**
- ❌ Epic has 2+ features
- ❌ Cross-feature integration points exist (even for 1-feature epics that touch shared modules)

---

## Overview

**What is S9?**
Epic-Level Final QC is where you validate the ENTIRE epic as a cohesive whole after ALL features are implemented. This includes epic smoke testing, validation loop QC (13 dimensions, primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation), user testing, and epic-level PR review.

**Total Time Estimate:** 4-7 hours (4 phases across 4 guides, validation loop approach)

**Exit Condition:** S9 is complete when epic smoke testing passed, validation loop achieved primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation, user testing passed (no bugs found), epic PR review passed (all 11 categories), and all issues resolved (no pending bug fixes)

---

## Sub-Stage Breakdown

### S9.P1: Epic Smoke Testing

**Read:** `stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Step 1:** Pre-QC Verification (verify all features at S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update), no pending bug fixes)
- **Step 2:** Epic Smoke Testing (4 parts: Import, Entry Point, E2E Execution, Cross-Feature Integration)

**Key Outputs:**
- Epic smoke testing results (PASSED for all 4 parts)
- DATA VALUE verification (not just file existence)
- Cross-feature integration scenarios tested
- Documented in epic_lessons_learned.md

**Time Estimate:** 60-90 minutes

**When complete:** Transition to S9.P2

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Focuses on functional validation before quality checks
- 4-part smoke testing ensures epic works end-to-end
- Mandatory gate before QC rounds (must pass to proceed)

---

### S9.P2: Epic QC Validation Loop

**Read:** `stages/s9/s9_p2_epic_qc_rounds.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Validation Loop:** Check ALL 13 dimensions every round (7 master + 6 epic-specific)
- **Exit Criteria:** primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation with ZERO issues
- **Issue Handling:** Fix immediately, reset `consecutive_clean`, continue (no restart for minor issues)

**Key Outputs:**
- VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md tracking all rounds
- All issues identified and resolved immediately
- primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation documented
- Documented in epic_lessons_learned.md

**Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours (typically 5-8 validation rounds)

**When complete:** Transition to S9.P3 (User Testing)

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Deep validation of epic quality using systematic validation loop
- ALL 13 dimensions checked EVERY round (comprehensive)
- Fix-and-continue approach (no restart overhead for minor issues)
- primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation ensuress thorough validation

---

### S9.P3: User Testing

**Read:** `stages/s9/s9_p3_user_testing.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Step 6:** User Testing & Bug Fix Protocol (user tests epic with real data and workflows)

**Key Outputs:**
- User testing request presented
- User testing results received
- All user-reported bugs fixed (if any)
- Epic validated by actual user
- EPIC_README.md updated with user testing results

**Time Estimate:** Variable (depends on user availability and bug count)

**When complete:** Transition to S9.P4 (Epic Final Review)

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- User testing catches issues automated testing misses
- Real-world validation with actual user workflows
- User perspective identifies usability problems
- Mandatory quality gate before final review

---

### S9.P4: Epic Final Review

**Read:** `stages/s9/s9_p4_epic_final_review.md`

**What it covers:**
- **Step 7:** Epic PR Review (11 Categories - Epic Scope)
- **Step 8:** Validate Against Epic Request (original user goals)
- **Step 9:** Final Verification & README Update

**Key Outputs:**
- Epic PR review results (all 11 categories PASSED)
- Bug fixes created (if issues found)
- S9 restarted after bug fixes (if applicable)
- EPIC_README.md updated (S9 complete)
- epic_lessons_learned.md updated
- Ready to proceed to S10

**Time Estimate:** 60-90 minutes (if no issues) + 2-4 hours per bug fix

**When complete:** S9 COMPLETE, ready for S10

**Why this sub-stage exists:**
- Final validation before epic completion
- 11-category PR review ensures comprehensive coverage

## Issue Handling Protocol

**S9.P2 (Validation Loop) - Fix and Continue:**

During S9.P2 Epic QC Validation Loop:
1. **Fix ALL issues immediately** (no deferring)
2. **Reset clean round counter** to 0
3. **Continue validation** until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation
4. **Document in VALIDATION_LOOP_LOG.md**

**Why fix and continue?**
- Faster than restarting entire S9 process
- Each fix is verified in subsequent rounds
- primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation ensuress quality
- 60-180 min saved per issue vs restart approach

---

**S9.P3 (User Testing) - Restart Required:**

When user reports bugs during S9.P3:
1. **Document bugs** using debugging protocol
2. **Fix ALL user-reported bugs**
3. **RESTART from S9.P1** (user bugs require full re-validation)
4. **Re-run S9.P1, S9.P2, return to S9.P3** for re-testing, then **S9.P4** before proceeding to S10

**Why restart for user bugs?**
- User-reported bugs indicate real-world issues
- Bug fixes may have affected validated areas
- Full re-validation ensures fixes are complete

**Cannot proceed to S10 until user reports "No bugs found".**

---

## Critical Rules (Same Across All Sub-Stages)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - Apply to ALL S9 sub-stages           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ ALWAYS use EVOLVED epic_smoke_test_plan.md (not original from S1)
   - Plan evolved through S3.P1 (if refined) and S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update)
   - Reflects actual implementation, not assumptions

2. ⚠️ Verify DATA VALUES, not just file existence
   - Files can exist with incorrect data
   - Check actual values in CSVs, JSONs, outputs

3. ⚠️ Epic-level validation focuses on INTEGRATION
   - Feature-level validation done in S7 (Testing & Review)
   - Focus: Cross-feature workflows, integration points, cohesion

4. ⚠️ S9.P2 uses VALIDATION LOOP (13 dimensions, primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
   - Check ALL 13 dimensions every round (7 master + 6 epic-specific)
   - primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation required to exit
   - Fix issues immediately, continue (no restart for S9.P2)

5. ⚠️ Issue handling differs by phase:
   - S9.P2: Fix immediately, reset counter, continue (validation loop)
   - S9.P3: User bugs require restart from S9.P1

6. ⚠️ Epic PR review has 11 categories (all mandatory)
   - Architecture category (Step 6.9) is MOST IMPORTANT
   - Focus on epic-wide concerns (not feature-level)

7. ⚠️ Validate against ORIGINAL epic request (not evolved specs)
   - Re-read `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt` file
   - Verify user's stated goals achieved

8. ⚠️ Test pass rate required throughout S9 (conditional on Testing Approach)
   - Options C/D: All unit tests must pass (100%)
   - Options B/D: All integration scripts must exit 0
   - Option A: No automated tests — smoke testing only
   - Fix ALL test failures before proceeding

9. ⚠️ Zero tolerance for epic-level quality issues
   - Architectural inconsistencies → HIGH priority bug fix
   - Performance regressions >100% → HIGH priority bug fix
   - Cross-feature errors → HIGH priority bug fix
```

## Why S9 Was Split

### Problems with Original Monolithic Guide (1,644 lines):

1. **Token inefficiency:** Agents loaded entire guide even when working on single step
2. **Navigation difficulty:** Hard to find specific step content in 1,644 line document
3. **Context dilution:** Important step-specific rules buried in massive guide
4. **Checkpoint confusion:** Unclear when to re-read guide vs continue

### Benefits of Split Guides:

1. **50-70% token reduction per step:**
   - S9.P1: ~829 lines vs 1,644 lines (50% reduction)
   - S9.P2: ~1,000 lines vs 1,644 lines (39% reduction)
   - S9.P3/P4: ~950 lines vs 1,644 lines (42% reduction)

2. **Clear step boundaries:**
   - Natural breakpoints at workflow transitions
   - Each guide has focused critical rules
   - Obvious transition points

3. **Improved navigation:**
   - Agents read only relevant step content
   - Faster guide comprehension
   - Easier to resume after session compaction

4. **Better mandatory reading protocol:**
   - Clear "read this guide" instruction per step
   - Step-specific acknowledgment prompts
   - Reduced guide abandonment

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to read all four sub-stage guides?**
A: Yes, but sequentially. Read S9.P1 first, complete it, then read S9.P2, complete it, then read S9.P3, then S9.P4.

**Q: Can I skip a step?**
A: No. All 8 steps are mandatory. The split doesn't change workflow, just organization.

**Q: What if I'm resuming mid-stage?**
A: Check EPIC_README.md Agent Status for current step, then read the guide for that step.

**Q: What if I find issues during S9.P2 (QC Validation Loop)?**
A: Fix issues immediately, reset `consecutive_clean` to 0, and continue validation. No restart needed for S9.P2. Continue until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation.

**Q: What if user finds bugs during S9.P3 (User Testing)?**
A: User-reported bugs require restart from S9.P1. Fix bugs using debugging protocol, then restart from S9.P1 (smoke testing) through S9.P2 (validation loop), return to S9.P3 (user re-testing), and then run S9.P4 (Epic Final Review) before proceeding to S10.

**Q: What's the difference between feature-level testing (S7) and epic-level testing (S9)?**
A: Feature-level testing (S7) validates features in ISOLATION. Epic-level testing (S9) validates features working TOGETHER as a cohesive system.

**Q: Can I use the original epic_smoke_test_plan.md from S1?**
A: No. You MUST use the EVOLVED epic_smoke_test_plan.md (finalized in S3.P1, updated in S8.P2 (Epic Testing Update)). The original plan is outdated.

**Q: Was there an original monolithic guide?**
A: Yes, S9 was originally a single 1,644-line guide. It has been split into four focused sub-stage guides (S9.P1, P2, P3, P4) for better token efficiency and navigation.

---

## Summary

**S9 is now split into four focused guides:**

1. **stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md** - Epic Smoke Testing (4 parts)
2. **stages/s9/s9_p2_epic_qc_rounds.md** - Epic QC Validation Loop (13 dimensions, primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
3. **stages/s9/s9_p3_user_testing.md** - User Testing & Bug Fix Protocol
4. **stages/s9/s9_p4_epic_final_review.md** - Epic Final Review (11 categories)

**Workflow:** Validation loop approach in S9.P2 (fix and continue, primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)

**Issue handling:**
- S9.P2: Fix immediately, continue (no restart)
- S9.P3: User bugs require restart from S9.P1

**Start here:** `stages/s9/s9_p1_epic_smoke_testing.md` (unless resuming mid-stage)

**Critical distinction:** Epic-level validation focuses on integration, cohesion, and cross-feature quality (NOT feature-level testing)
