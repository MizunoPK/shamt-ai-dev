## 🚨 MANDATORY READING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL:** You MUST read this ENTIRE guide before starting S9.P4 work.

**Why this matters:**
- S9.P4 is the FINAL VALIDATION before epic completion
- Missing steps here means shipping incomplete or incorrect epic
- Thoroughness prevents post-completion issues

**Reading Checkpoint:**
Before proceeding, you must have:
- [ ] Read this ENTIRE guide (use Read tool, not memory)
- [ ] Verified S9.P3 complete (User Testing passed with ZERO bugs)
- [ ] Verified no pending issues or bug fixes
- [ ] Located epic_lessons_learned.md file

**If resuming after session compaction:**
1. Check EPIC_README.md "Agent Status" section for current step
2. Re-read this guide from the beginning
3. Continue from documented checkpoint

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN SHORTCUTS

You CANNOT:
- Skip Step 6 (Epic PR Review) or any of its 11 categories because "S9.P2 already covered them" — all 11 categories are MANDATORY; S9.P2 results provide supplementary context only, not a replacement for the epic PR review
- Fix issues found in Step 6 inline instead of creating bug fix folders — ALL high/medium priority issues require a bug fix folder and the full S2→S5→S6→S7 workflow
- Proceed to Step 8 (Final Verification) after creating bug fixes without restarting S9 from S9.P1 — the S9 restart is MANDATORY after any bug fixes created in Step 7
- Mark S9.P4 complete without updating both EPIC_README.md Epic Progress Tracker and epic_lessons_learned.md with S9.P4 results and insights

If you are about to do any of the above: STOP and re-read the relevant section.

---

## Overview

### What is this sub-stage?

**S9.P4 - Epic Final Review** is the final validation phase of S9, where you apply an epic-level PR review checklist, handle any discovered issues through bug fixes, and perform final verification before declaring the epic complete.

**This is NOT feature-level review** - S7 (Testing & Review) already reviewed individual features. This focuses on:
- Epic-wide architectural consistency
- Cross-feature code quality
- Epic scope and completeness
- Final validation against original request

### When do you use this guide?

**Use this guide when:**
- S9.P2 complete (validation loop achieved 3 consecutive clean rounds)
- S9.P1 epic smoke testing passed (all 4 parts)
- S9.P3 user testing passed (user reports "No bugs found")
- Ready for final epic-level PR review and validation

**Do NOT use this guide if:**
- S9.P1 smoke testing not complete
- S9.P2 validation loop not complete (3 consecutive clean rounds required)
- S9.P3 user testing not complete
- Pending bug fixes not yet completed

### What are the key outputs?

1. **Epic PR Review Results** (documented in epic_lessons_learned.md)
   - 11 categories reviewed at epic level
   - All categories must pass (no failures)

2. **Bug Fixes (if issues found)**
   - Bug fix folders created for any issues
   - S9 RESTARTED after bug fixes

3. **Final Verification**
   - All S9 steps confirmed complete
   - epic_lessons_learned.md updated
   - EPIC_README.md marked complete

4. **S9 Completion**
   - Ready to proceed to S10 (Epic Cleanup)

### Time estimate

**60-90 minutes** (if no issues found)
- Epic PR Review: 30-45 minutes
- Final Verification: 15-30 minutes
- Documentation updates: 15 minutes

**+2-4 hours per bug fix** (if issues found, includes S9 restart)

## Critical Rules for S9.P4

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CRITICAL RULES - S9.P4 (Epic Final Review)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ⚠️ Epic-level PR review focuses on CROSS-FEATURE concerns
   - Feature-level review already done in S7 (Testing & Review)
   - Focus: Architectural consistency, cross-feature impacts
   - Don't repeat feature-level checks

2. ⚠️ ALL 11 categories are MANDATORY

---

## S9.P2 Validation Overlap Awareness

**If S9.P2 achieved 3 consecutive clean rounds:**

S9.P2's 12-dimension validation provides strong coverage of many PR review categories. The following have significant overlap:

**Categories with High S9.P2 Coverage (trust but verify):**
- **Category 1 (Correctness):** S9.P2 Dimension 1 (Empirical Verification) validated all integrations
- **Category 2 (Code Quality):** S9.P2 Dimension 5 (Clarity & Specificity) validated naming, structure
- **Category 5 (Testing):** S9.P2 Dimension 12 (Success Criteria) required 100% test pass
- **Category 8 (Error Handling):** S9.P2 Dimension 10 (Error Handling Consistency) validated patterns
- **Category 9 (Architecture):** S9.P2 Dimensions 8 & 11 (Integration, Alignment) validated design

**Categories with Lower S9.P2 Coverage (focus review here):**
- **Category 6 (Security):** Not heavily covered in S9.P2 dimensions
- **Category 7 (Performance):** Not heavily covered in S9.P2 dimensions
- **Category 10 (Backwards Compatibility):** Not covered in S9.P2 dimensions
- **Category 11 (Scope & Changes):** Validate against ORIGINAL user request (not just specs)
- **Category 4 (Comments & Documentation):** Epic-level documentation only

**Approach:**
- **Still review ALL 11 categories** (no skipping)
- **For high-overlap categories:** Quick verification, trust S9.P2 findings
- **For low-overlap categories:** Thorough review, these are new checks
- **Defense in depth:** Redundancy is acceptable for critical categories (Correctness, Architecture)

**Note:** This guidance applies ONLY when S9.P2 achieved 3 consecutive clean rounds. If S9.P2 had issues or was shortened, review all 11 categories thoroughly.

---

## STEP 6: Epic PR Review (Multi-Round with Fresh Eyes)

**🚨 MANDATORY: READ PR REVIEW PROTOCOL**

**Before proceeding, you MUST:**
1. **READ:** `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md`
2. **Follow the complete hybrid approach:**
   - Round 1: 4 specialized reviews (fresh agent for each)
   - Rounds 2-5: Repeated comprehensive reviews (fresh agent for each)
   - 2 consecutive clean rounds required to pass
   - Maximum 5 rounds total

**Purpose:** Systematic epic-level PR review using fresh agent context to catch issues before final commit.

**Why fresh agents?** New agents avoid context bias and provide "fresh eyes" on epic-wide changes.

---

### Overview

**Objective:** Apply PR review protocol to epic-wide changes with focus on architectural consistency.

**This is NOT feature-level review:**
- S7 (Testing & Review) already reviewed individual feature correctness
- S9.P4 reviews EPIC-WIDE concerns:
  - Architectural consistency ACROSS features
  - Code duplication BETWEEN features
  - Cross-feature integration quality
  - Epic scope completeness
  - Original epic request validation

**Round Structure:**

**Round 1 (Specialized - 4 Fresh Agents):**
- **Round 1a:** Code Quality (epic level) - Fresh agent
- **Round 1b:** Testing & Performance - Fresh agent
- **Round 1c:** Security & Error Handling - Fresh agent
- **Round 1d:** Documentation & Scope - Fresh agent

**Rounds 2-5 (Comprehensive - Fresh Agent Each):**
- Each round: Fresh agent reviews ALL 11 categories
- 2 consecutive clean rounds required to pass
- Maximum 5 total rounds

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**See:** `reference/stage_9/epic_pr_review_checklist.md` for complete 11-category checklist

**Step 6.1: Apply Round 1 (Specialized Reviews)**

1. **Create pr_review_issues.md file:**
   ```text
   Location: SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/pr_review_issues.md
   Purpose: Track issues discovered during PR review rounds
   ```

2. **Launch Round 1a (Code Quality - Fresh Agent):**
   - Code Quality (Epic Level)
   - Code Organization & Refactoring (Epic Level)

3. **Launch Round 1b (Testing & Performance - Fresh Agent):**
   - Testing (Epic Level)
   - Performance (Epic Level)

4. **Launch Round 1c (Security & Error Handling - Fresh Agent):**
   - Security (Epic Level)
   - Error Handling (Epic Level)

5. **Launch Round 1d (Documentation & Scope - Fresh Agent):**
   - Comments & Documentation (Epic Level)
   - Scope & Changes (Epic Level)

**Step 6.2: Apply Rounds 2-5 (Comprehensive Reviews)**

**For each round (2-5), launch fresh agent to review ALL 11 categories:**

1. Correctness (Epic Level)
2. Code Quality (Epic Level)
3. Comments & Documentation (Epic Level)
4. Code Organization & Refactoring (Epic Level)
5. Testing (Epic Level)
6. Security (Epic Level)
7. Performance (Epic Level)
8. Error Handling (Epic Level)
9. **Architecture (Epic Level - CRITICAL)**
10. Backwards Compatibility (Epic Level)
11. Scope & Changes (Epic Level)

**Each fresh agent:**
- Reviews ALL 11 categories
- Documents issues in pr_review_issues.md
- Returns comprehensive report

**Passing Criteria:**
- 2 consecutive rounds with ZERO issues = PASS
- If issues found in any round → Fix and continue
- Maximum 5 rounds total

**Step 6.3: Document PR Review Results**

**Update epic_lessons_learned.md with results:**

**See:** `reference/stage_9/epic_final_review_templates.md` Template 1 for PR review results template

**Include:**
- Date, epic name, total rounds
- Final status (PASSED/FAILED)
- Review summary (what was found in each round)
- Total issues found and fixed
- Epic-level concerns addressed

---

## STEP 7: Handle Issues (If Any Discovered)

**When to use:** ANY category failed in Step 6 PR review

**When to SKIP:** All 11 categories passed, no issues discovered

---

### Overview

**Objective:** Create bug fixes for any epic-level integration issues discovered during Step 6.

**Critical Rule:** After bug fixes, you MUST COMPLETELY RESTART S9 from S9.P1.

**Why RESTART?** Bug fixes may have affected areas already checked. Cannot assume previous QC results still valid.

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**See:** `reference/stage_9/epic_final_review_templates.md` Templates 2-6 for issue handling templates

**Step 7.1: Document ALL Issues**

**See:** Template 2 (Issues Found Documentation)

Document in epic_lessons_learned.md:
- Issue description
- Discovered in (which category)
- Impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Root cause
- Fix required
- Priority (high/medium/low)

**Step 7.2: Determine Bug Fix Priorities**

**See:** Template 3 (Issue Prioritization)

**Priority Levels:**
- **high:** Breaks functionality, security, architecture, performance >100% regression
- **medium:** Affects quality (consistency, error messages, minor performance)
- **low:** Cosmetic only (comments, variable names) - document only, no bug fix

**Step 7.3: Present Issues to User**

**See:** Template 4 (User Presentation)

Present ALL high/medium priority issues to user for approval before creating bug fixes.

**Step 7.4: Create Bug Fixes Using Bug Fix Workflow**

**See:** Template 5 (Bug Fix Folder Structure)

For EACH issue:
1. Create bug fix folder (bugfix_{priority}_{name}/)
2. Create notes.txt with issue description
3. Run through bug fix workflow: S2 → S5 → S6 → S7
4. Bug fix stays in epic folder (doesn't move to done/)

**Step 7.5: RESTART S9 After Bug Fixes**

**See:** Template 6 (S9 Restart Documentation)

**CRITICAL:** You MUST COMPLETELY RESTART S9 after ALL bug fixes complete.

**Restart Protocol:**
1. Mark all S9 steps as "incomplete" in EPIC_README.md
2. Re-run S9.P1 (Epic Smoke Testing - all 4 parts)
3. Re-run S9.P2 (Epic QC Validation Loop - until 3 consecutive clean rounds)
4. Re-run S9.P4 (Epic Final Review - all 11 categories)
5. Document restart in epic_lessons_learned.md

---

## STEP 8: Final Verification & README Update

**When to use:** Step 6 passed (all 11 categories) AND Step 7 complete OR skipped (no issues)

---

### Overview

**Objective:** Verify S9.P3 complete, all issues resolved, update epic documentation.

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**See:** `reference/stage_9/epic_final_review_templates.md` Templates 7-10 for verification templates

**Step 8.1: Verify All Issues Resolved**

**See:** Template 7 (Final Verification Checklist)

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] S9.P1 Epic smoke testing passed (all 4 parts)
- [ ] S9.P2 Epic QC Validation Loop passed (3 consecutive clean rounds)
- [ ] All 12 dimensions validated (7 master + 5 epic)
- [ ] S9.P3 User testing passed (no bugs found)
- [ ] Epic PR review passed (all 11 categories)
- [ ] NO pending issues or bug fixes
- [ ] ALL tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Run all tests to confirm:**
```bash
{TEST_COMMAND}
## Expected: 100% pass rate, exit code 0
```

**If ANY item unchecked:** STOP - Address remaining issues, re-run affected steps

**Step 8.2: Update EPIC_README.md Epic Progress Tracker**

**See:** Template 8 (Epic Progress Tracker Update)

Mark S9 complete, including:
- S9.P1, P2, P3, P4 completion status
- Issues found and resolved
- Bug fixes completed
- S9 restarts (if any)
- Date completed

**Step 8.3: Update epic_lessons_learned.md**

**See:** Template 9 (S9.P4 Lessons Learned)

Add S9.P4 insights:
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Issues found & resolved
- Insights for future epics
- Guide improvements needed
- Statistics (time, issues, bug fixes)
- Key takeaway

**Step 8.4: Update EPIC_README.md Agent Status**

**See:** Template 10 (Agent Status Update)

Mark S9.P4 complete and prepare for S10:
- Current stage: S9.P4
- Status: COMPLETE
- S9 summary (all parts, results)
- Next stage: stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md
- Next action: Read epic cleanup guide

**Step 8.5: Completion Indicator**

**S9.P4 is COMPLETE when ALL of these are true:**

## Summary

**S9.P4 - Epic Final Review is the final validation before epic completion:**

**Key Activities:**
1. **Epic PR Review (Step 6):** Apply 11-category checklist to epic-wide changes
   - Focus: Architectural consistency, cross-feature impacts, epic scope
   - Critical category: Architecture (Step 6.9)
   - Document results in epic_lessons_learned.md

2. **Handle Issues (Step 7):** Create bug fixes for any discovered issues
   - Document all issues comprehensively
   - Create bug fixes using bug fix workflow
   - RESTART S9 from S9.P1 after fixes

3. **Final Verification (Step 8):** Confirm S9 complete
   - Verify all issues resolved
   - Update EPIC_README.md (Epic Progress Tracker, Agent Status)
   - Update epic_lessons_learned.md with insights

**Critical Distinctions:**
- **Feature-level PR review (S7 (Testing & Review)):** Reviews individual features in isolation
- **Epic-level PR review (S9.P4):** Reviews cross-feature consistency, architectural cohesion, epic scope

**Success Criteria:**
- Epic PR review passed (all 11 categories)
- All issues resolved (bug fixes complete OR no issues)
- No pending issues or bug fixes
- All tests passing (100%)
- Original epic goals achieved
- Ready to proceed to S10

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Repeating feature-level review instead of epic-level
- Fixing issues inline instead of using bug fix workflow
- Skipping Architecture category review (most important)
- Comparing to specs instead of original epic request
- Accepting issues instead of creating bug fixes
- Not documenting PR review results
- Proceeding to S10 with pending issues

**See:** `reference/stage_9/epic_final_review_examples.md` for detailed examples of each mistake and best practices

**Remember:** S9.P4 is the LAST CHANCE to catch epic-level issues before shipping. Thoroughness here prevents post-completion rework and ensures epic delivers on user's vision.
