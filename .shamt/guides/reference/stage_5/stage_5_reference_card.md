## Mandatory Gates Across S5

### S5: TODO Creation (4 gates)

**Gate 1: Iteration 4a - TODO Specification Audit**
- **Location:** stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md
- **Criteria:** ALL TODO tasks have acceptance criteria
- **Evidence:** Task count, criteria count, 100% coverage
- **If FAIL:** Add missing acceptance criteria, re-run Iteration 4a

**Gate 2 (Gate 23a): Pre-Implementation Spec Audit**
- **Location:** stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (Dimension 11)
- **Embedded in:** Dimension 11 (Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation)
- **Criteria:** ALL 5 PARTS must PASS with 100% metrics
  - Part 1: Completeness Audit (all requirements have implementation tasks)
  - Part 2: Specificity Audit (all tasks have criteria, location, tests)
  - Part 3: Interface Contracts Audit (all dependencies verified from source)
  - Part 4: Integration Evidence Audit (all methods have callers)
  - Part 5: Cross-validation (spec.md matches validated sources)
- **Evidence:** Cite specific numbers (N requirements, M tasks, coverage %)
- **If FAIL:** Fix issues immediately, re-validate in next round

**Gate 3 (Gate 25): Spec Validation Check**
- **Location:** stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (Dimension 11)
- **Embedded in:** Dimension 11 (Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation)
- **Criteria:** Spec.md matches ALL three validated sources (epic notes + epic ticket + spec summary)
- **Process:** Close spec.md first, re-read validated docs independently, three-way comparison
- **If ANY DISCREPANCIES:** STOP, report to user with 3 options
- **Critical:** Prevents spec misinterpretation bugs
- **If FAIL:** User decides next action (fix spec + restart, fix spec + continue, discuss)

**Gate 4 (Gate 24): Implementation Readiness (GO/NO-GO)**
- **Location:** stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (Dimension 10)
- **Embedded in:** Dimension 10 (Implementation Readiness)
- **Criteria:** GO decision required (confidence >= MEDIUM, all embedded gates PASSED, checklists complete)
- **If NO-GO:** Address concerns, cannot proceed to S6
- **If GO:** Proceed to S6 implementation

### S7: Post-Implementation (2 gates)

**Gate 5: S7.P1 Part 3 - E2E Smoke Test (Data Values)**
- **Location:** stages/s7/s7_p1_smoke_testing.md
- **Criteria:** E2E test with REAL data, verify DATA VALUES (not just file existence)
- **If FAIL:** Restart from S7.P1 Step 1

**Gate 6: S7.P2 Validation Loop - 3 Consecutive Clean Rounds**
- **Location:** stages/s7/s7_p2_qc_rounds.md
- **Criteria:** 3 consecutive rounds with ZERO issues found
- **If issues found:** Fix immediately, reset counter, continue (fix-and-continue approach)

---

## Validation Loop Protocol

**If smoke testing fails (S7.P1):**
→ Fix issues, restart from S7.P1 Step 1 (Import Test)

**If issues found during Validation Loop (S7.P2):**
→ Fix issues immediately, reset clean counter to 0, continue validation
→ No restart needed - fix-and-continue approach
→ Continue until 3 consecutive clean rounds achieved

**If PR review finds critical issues (S7.P3):**
→ Fix issues, restart from S7.P1 Step 1 (smoke testing)

**Why fix-and-continue?**
- Check ALL 11 dimensions every round
- Fix issues immediately when found
- More efficient than full restart protocol
- Zero tech debt tolerance - no deferring issues

### Complex Feature (35+ TODO tasks - consider splitting)
- 5a: 3 hours
- 5b: 3-4 hours
- 5c: 2.5 hours
- 5d+5e: 1 hour
- **Total:** ~10 hours

## Critical Rules Summary

### S5 (TODO Creation)
- ✅ Complete Validation Loop: all 11 dimensions, 3 consecutive clean rounds (no skipping)
- ✅ Execute iterations IN ORDER (not parallel)
- ✅ Pass ALL 4 mandatory gates (4a, 23a, 25, 24)
- ✅ Achieve >90% test coverage (Round 2)
- ✅ Evidence-based verification (cite specific numbers)
- ✅ Close spec.md before Dimension 11 validation (avoid confirmation bias)

### S6 (Implementation)
- ✅ Keep spec.md VISIBLE at all times
- ✅ Mini-QC checkpoints every 5-7 TODO tasks
- ✅ 100% unit test pass after each step
- ✅ Interface verification against ACTUAL source code

### S7 (Post-Implementation)
- ✅ Verify DATA VALUES in smoke testing (not just file existence)
- ✅ Validation Loop requires 3 consecutive clean rounds
- ✅ If issues found → fix immediately, reset counter, continue
- ✅ Zero tech debt tolerance (fix ALL issues immediately)
- ✅ PR review covers all 11 categories

### S8.P1 & 5e
- ✅ Update specs ONLY for remaining (not yet implemented) features
- ✅ Reassess epic test plan after EACH feature completes

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Skipping Iterations
**Problem:** "Iteration 19 looks similar to 4, I'll skip it"
**Impact:** Missing algorithm mappings, bugs escape to QC
**Solution:** ALL 11 dimensions are mandatory (each catches different issue types), and 3 consecutive clean rounds required

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Just Checking Boxes (No Evidence)
**Problem:** Saying "Coverage = 100%" without citing N requirements, M tasks
**Impact:** Gates FAIL (no evidence = didn't actually verify)
**Solution:** Cite specific numbers for every verification

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Not Closing Spec.md in Dimension 11 validation
**Problem:** Reading spec.md while comparing to epic notes
**Impact:** Confirmation bias - see what you expect, not what's written
**Solution:** Close spec.md FIRST, re-read validated docs independently

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Skipping Smoke Testing After Bug Fix
**Problem:** "I only changed one line, smoke testing not needed"
**Impact:** Small change breaks integration, bugs escape to S9
**Solution:** ALWAYS restart from smoke testing after ANY code change

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Deferring QC Issues to "Later"
**Problem:** "This is minor, I'll fix it after S9"
**Impact:** Tech debt accumulates, bugs compound, rework in production
**Solution:** Zero tech debt tolerance - fix ALL issues immediately

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Mock Audit Assumptions (Dimension 11 validation)
**Problem:** "I assume this mock matches the real interface"
**Impact:** Unit tests pass with wrong mocks, integration tests fail
**Solution:** READ actual source code, verify EACH mock against real interface
