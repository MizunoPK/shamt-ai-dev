## S9 Epic QC Dimensions (5) - Context-Specific

These 5 dimensions are specific to S9.P2 Epic QC validation:

### Dimension 8: Cross-Feature Integration

**Question:** Do features integrate correctly with each other?

**Checklist:**

**Integration Point Verification:**
- [ ] All integration points between features identified
- [ ] All interface contracts verified (method signatures match)
- [ ] Data flow verified between all features
- [ ] Error propagation tested across feature boundaries

**Data Exchange:**
- [ ] Data structures compatible across features
- [ ] Data validation present at feature boundaries
- [ ] Data transformation correct between features
- [ ] Shared resources accessed correctly by all features

**Example Verification:**
```python
## Integration: Feature 01 -> Feature 02
from feature_01.RecordManager import DataRecordDataManager
from feature_02.RatingSystem import RatingSystem

## Verify data flows correctly
items = PlayerDataManager().get_all_items()
rated_players = RatingSystem().apply_ratings(items)

## Verify no data loss
assert len(rated_players) == len(items)
assert all(hasattr(p, 'rating') for p in rated_players)
```

### Dimension 9: Epic Cohesion

**Question:** Is the epic architecturally cohesive and consistent?

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Logging format consistent

**Pattern Consistency:**

- [ ] Configuration access consistent
- [ ] Resource management consistent

**Common Violations:**

Wrong - Inconsistent patterns:
```python
## Feature 01: get_all_items()
## Feature 02: get_rated_players()  # Consistent
## Feature 03: fetch_recommendations()  # Different pattern
```

Correct - Consistent patterns:
```python
## Feature 01: get_all_items()
## Feature 02: get_rated_players()
## Feature 03: get_recommendations()  # Consistent
```

---

### Dimension 10: Error Handling Consistency

**Question:** Is error handling consistent across all features?

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Upstream errors handled the same way
- [ ] Downstream errors propagated consistently
- [ ] Critical errors escalated the same way

**Common Violations:**

Wrong - Inconsistent error handling:
```python
## Feature 01: Raises DataProcessingError
except FileNotFoundError:
    raise DataProcessingError("Record data not found")

## Feature 03: Returns None
except FileNotFoundError:
    return None  # Inconsistent
```

Correct - Consistent error handling:
```python
## Feature 01: Raises DataProcessingError
except FileNotFoundError:
    raise DataProcessingError("Record data not found")

## Feature 03: Also raises DataProcessingError
except FileNotFoundError:
    raise DataProcessingError("Settings not found")
```

2. Check integration points between features
3. Verify data flow across feature boundaries
4. Check all 12 dimensions

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 12 dimensions checked (7 master + 5 epic)
- [ ] Integration points verified
- [ ] Data flow validated
- [ ] Tests passing (100%)

### Round 2: Reverse Order + Consistency Focus

**Pattern:**

2. Focus on consistency across features
3. Compare patterns between features
4. Check all 12 dimensions

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 12 dimensions checked
- [ ] Naming consistency verified
- [ ] Error handling consistency verified
- [ ] Architectural patterns compatible

### Round 3: Random Spot-Checks + Success Criteria

**Pattern:**
1. Random spot-check 3-5 integration points
2. Verify success criteria from original epic request
3. End-to-end scenario validation
4. Check all 12 dimensions

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All 12 dimensions checked
- [ ] Spot-checked integrations work correctly
- [ ] Success criteria met (100%)
- [ ] Ready for user testing

## Common Issues in S9 QC Context

### Issue 1: Integration Point Failures

**Symptom:** Features don't communicate correctly

**Example:**
```python
## Feature 01 returns List[DataRecord]
## Feature 02 expects Dict[str, DataRecord]
## Integration fails with TypeError
```

**Fix:** Verify interface contracts match, add data transformation if needed

---

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Error Handling

**Symptom:** Different features handle errors differently

**Example:**
```python
## Feature 01: raises exception on error
## Feature 02: returns None on error
## Integration breaks due to unexpected None
```

**Fix:** Standardize error handling approach across all features

---

### Issue 3: Missing Success Criteria

**Symptom:** Epic doesn't fully meet original request

**Example:**
```markdown
Original goal: "Generate top 200 items"
Implementation: Only generates top 100 items
```

**Fix:** Review original epic request and implement missing functionality

---

### Issue 4: Architectural Inconsistencies

**Symptom:** Features use incompatible patterns

**Example:**
```python
## Feature 01: Singleton pattern for config
## Feature 02: Instance-based config
## Conflict when accessing shared configuration
```

**Fix:** Standardize architectural patterns across features

---
