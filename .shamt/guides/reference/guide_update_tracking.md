# Guide Update Tracking - Proposal Docs and Rejected Lessons

**Purpose:** Track which lessons learned from epics have been captured in guide update proposal docs, enabling pattern analysis and continuous improvement

**Use Case:** After each epic's S10.P1, document accepted proposals (with proposal doc path) and rejected lessons to maintain history and identify patterns

---

## Overview

This document tracks the feedback loop from implementation → lessons learned → guide update proposals:

1. **Epic completes** → Generates lessons_learned.md files
2. **Agent analyzes lessons** → Creates GUIDE_UPDATE_PROPOSAL.md
3. **User approves proposals** → Agent creates proposal doc in `.shamt/unimplemented_design_proposals/`
4. **Agent logs here** → Creates traceable history (proposal doc path + rejected lessons)

**Benefits:**
- Visibility into guide evolution over time
- Pattern detection across multiple epics
- Accountability for applied vs rejected changes
- Evidence of continuous improvement

## Applied Lessons Log

**Format (SHAMT-18+):** Epic | Priority | Lesson Summary | Affected Guide(s) | Date | Proposal doc | Proposal commit

**Note:** Entries before 2026-03-25 (pre-SHAMT-18) were applied directly to guides without a proposal doc. New entries include the proposal doc path.

| Epic | Priority | Lesson Summary | Affected Guide(s) | Date | Proposal doc | Proposal commit |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| SHAMT-11-game_data_fetcher_cli | P1 | S9 Single-Feature Epic Shortcut — skip S9.P1 and S9.P2 for epics with exactly 1 feature and no cross-feature integration; S9.P3 remains mandatory | s9_epic_final_qc.md (Quick Navigation) | 2026-02-20 | pending |
| SHAMT-11-game_data_fetcher_cli | P1 | "Port the Spec" Mode Trigger Warning — when S2 is framed as porting an existing spec, extra vigilance needed; new decisions found during "verification" still require PENDING → User approval | s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md (Correct Status Progression Protocol) | 2026-02-20 | pending |
| SHAMT-11-game_data_fetcher_cli | P2 | Fix ALL Known Gaps BEFORE Validation Loop — "known gaps OK" applies to Phase 1 drafting, not when starting Phase 2; resolve all Phase 1 Known Gaps before Round 1 | s5_v2_validation_loop.md (Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition) | 2026-02-20 | pending |

**Instructions:**
- Add one row per accepted/modified proposal (even if multiple guides affected)
- If one lesson affects multiple guides, list all in "Affected Guide(s)" column
- Include proposal doc path and commit hash for traceability
- Keep sorted by date (newest first)

---

## Pending Lessons

**Format:** Lessons identified but not yet resolved (user marked "Discuss" — awaiting clarification)

| Epic | Priority | Lesson Summary | Proposed Guide(s) | Status | Reason Pending |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| {Example - delete after use} |
| SHAMT-2-example | P2 | Add example of integration gap | s5_v2_validation_loop.md | User Discuss | Needs clarification on example format |

**Instructions:**
- Add lessons where user marked "Discuss" and hasn't yet decided
- Remove once user approves (move to Applied Lessons Log) or rejects (move to Rejected Lessons)

---

## Rejected Lessons

**Format:** Lessons user rejected with rationale (helps avoid re-proposing same changes)

| Epic | Priority | Lesson Summary | Proposed Guide(s) | Date Rejected | User Rationale |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| {Example - delete after use} |
| SHAMT-3-example | P3 | Add typo fix | workflow_diagrams.md | 2026-01-10 | Too minor, not worth guide churn |

**Instructions:**
- Document all rejected proposals to avoid re-proposing
- Include user's rationale to understand why rejected
- Helps identify proposals that consistently get rejected

---

## Pattern Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify common lesson patterns across epics to drive systematic guide improvements

### Pattern 1: {Pattern Name}

**Observed In:**
- SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name} - {brief description}
- SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name} - {brief description}
- SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name} - {brief description}

**Root Cause:**
{Why this pattern keeps appearing}

**Guide Impact:**
- {Guide 1} - {How updated to address pattern}
- {Guide 2} - {How updated to address pattern}

**Status:** {Fully Addressed / Partially Addressed / Monitoring}

**Next Steps:**
{What additional changes might be needed}

### Pattern 2: {Pattern Name}

{Same structure...}

## Usage Notes

### For Agents

**After S10.P1 (Guide Update Workflow):**
1. For each approved proposal, add entry to "Applied Lessons Log"
2. For each modified proposal, add entry with user's modification
3. For each rejected proposal, add entry to "Rejected Lessons" with rationale
4. Update metrics section (counts, approval rates)
5. Look for patterns: if same lesson appears 2+ times, create Pattern Analysis entry

### For Users

**Reviewing this document:**
- Check "Applied Lessons Log" to see what improvements have been made
- Review "Pattern Analysis" to understand systemic improvements
- Check metrics to see if approval rates match expectations
- Use "Rejected Lessons" to understand why certain proposals were declined

**Quarterly review:**
- Every 10-20 epics, review Pattern Analysis
- Identify if certain guides need major restructuring vs incremental updates
- Determine if workflow is generating valuable proposals

---

## Maintenance

**Update frequency:**
- After every epic's S10.P1 (Applied Lessons Log, Pending, Rejected)
- Monthly: Update metrics section
- Quarterly: Update pattern analysis, identify systemic improvements

**Quality checks:**
- Ensure commit hashes are accurate and traceable
- Verify all approved lessons are logged (none missing)
- Check that patterns are actionable (not just observations)
- Confirm metrics calculations are correct

## Examples (DELETE AFTER FIRST REAL USE)

### Example: Applied Lesson Entry

**Epic:** SHAMT-1-improve_recommendation_engine
**Priority:** P0
**Lesson:** "S5 Dimension 11 (Spec Alignment & Cross-Validation) caught that spec.md misinterpreted epic notes about week_N+1 folder logic. Epic said 'create week folders' but spec said 'no code changes needed for folders.' Validation dimension prevented week+ of rework."
**Guide Updated:** `reference/mandatory_gates.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Added historical context to Dimension 11 validation
- Emphasized importance of three-way comparison (epic notes, epic ticket, spec summary)
- Added example of spec misinterpretation caught by this gate
**Date Applied:** 2026-01-10
**Commit Hash:** abc1234

**Guide Updated:** `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md (D10, D11: Gates 24, 25)`
**Changes Made:**
- Added emphasis to "close spec.md and implementation_plan.md" step
- Added "ask critical questions" examples specific to folder/file operations
- Added success story showing gate catching misinterpretation
**Date Applied:** 2026-01-10
**Commit Hash:** abc1234
