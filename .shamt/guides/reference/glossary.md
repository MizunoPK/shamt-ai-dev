## How to Use This Glossary

Terms are organized alphabetically. Terms with multiple context-specific meanings show all contexts with clear labels.

## Hierarchical Notation System

**The workflow uses a 3-level hierarchical S#.P#.I# notation system:**

| Level | Notation | Prefix | Example | Description | Term |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|------|
| **Level 1** | S# | S | `S5` | Top-level workflow stage | **Stage** |
| **Level 2** | S#.P# | P | `S5.P1` | Major subdivision within stage | **Phase** |
| **Level 3** | S#.P#.I# | I | `S5.P1.I2` | Specific iteration/task within phase | **Iteration** |

**Within files (not part of file hierarchy):**
- **Steps** — Numbered tasks within a guide (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)

**Examples in practice:**
- **S5** = Feature Implementation (Level 1 - Stage)
- **S5.P1** = Implementation Planning Round 1 (Level 2 - Phase)
- **S5.P1.I2** = Iteration 2 within Round 1 (Level 3 - Iteration)

**File naming:**
- Stages: `s{N}/` (e.g., `s1/`, `s5/`)
- Phases: `s{N}_p{M}_{name}.md` (e.g., `s8_p1_cross_feature_alignment.md`)
- Iterations: `s{N}_p{M}_i{K}_{name}.md` (e.g., `s5_p1_i2_validation.md`)

**See:** `reference/naming_conventions.md` for complete specification
