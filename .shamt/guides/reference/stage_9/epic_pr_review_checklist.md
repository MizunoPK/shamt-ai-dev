# Epic PR Review Checklist - 11 Categories

**Purpose:** Complete checklist for epic-level PR review (S9.P3 Step 6)
**When to Use:** After S9.P2 QC rounds complete, before final verification
**Main Guide:** `stages/s9/s9_p4_epic_final_review.md`

---

## Overview

Epic-level PR review focuses on CROSS-FEATURE concerns that emerge when multiple features work together. Individual features were already reviewed in S7.

**Epic Review Focus:**
- Architectural consistency across features
- Cross-feature integration points
- Code quality consistency between features
- Epic-wide patterns and abstractions

**NOT Reviewed Here:**
- Individual feature correctness (already validated in S7)
- Feature-specific implementation details (unless they affect other features)

**Review Protocol:**
This checklist supplements the complete PR review protocol. See `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md` for:
- Hybrid multi-round approach (Round 1: 4 specialized reviews, Rounds 2-5: comprehensive reviews)
- Fresh agent spawning via Task tool
- pr_review_issues.md tracking
- primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation required

## How to Use This Checklist

**During Epic PR Review (Step 6):**
1. Follow `reference/validation_loop_qc_pr.md` for complete review process
2. Spawn fresh agents for each review round
3. Use this checklist as **reference for epic-level considerations**
4. Fresh agents automatically apply 11-category checklist during Rounds 2-5
5. Document findings in `SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/pr_review_issues.md`
6. Continue until primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation achieved

**Epic-Specific Agent Prompt:**
When spawning fresh agents, provide this context:
```markdown
This is an EPIC-LEVEL PR review covering {N} features:
{List feature names}

**Your focus:**
- Architectural consistency across features
- Cross-feature integration points
- Code quality consistency between features
- No duplication across features
- Epic-wide patterns and abstractions

**NOT your focus:**
- Individual feature correctness (already validated in S7)
- Feature-specific implementation details (unless they affect other features)

**Code to review:**
{Provide git diff showing ALL epic changes across all features}
{Provide paths to all feature folders}
```

## Category 1: Correctness (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Do all features implement requirements correctly AND work correctly together?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All features implement their requirements correctly (per specs)
- [ ] Cross-feature workflows produce correct results
- [ ] Integration points function correctly (no data corruption)
- [ ] No logic errors in epic-wide flows
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly across feature boundaries

### How to Verify

```python
- Example: Verify cross-feature workflow correctness
- Epic: Improve Draft Helper (rank priority + Matchup + Performance)

- 1. Verify Feature 01 (rank priority) correctness
from feature_01.rank_manager import RankManager
rank_mgr = RankManager()
multiplier, rank = rank_mgr.get_rank_data("Record-A")
assert 0.5 <= multiplier <= 1.5, "rank multiplier out of valid range"
assert rank > 0, "rank priority rank invalid"

- 2. Verify Feature 02 (Matchup) correctness
from feature_02.matchup_manager import MatchupManager
matchup_mgr = MatchupManager()
difficulty = matchup_mgr.get_matchup_difficulty("Record-A", week=5)
assert 0.5 <= difficulty <= 1.5, "Matchup difficulty out of valid range"

- 3. Verify INTEGRATION correctness
from [module].util.DataRecord import DataRecord
item = DataRecord("Record-A", "QB", 300.0)
- Apply both multipliers
final_score = item.score * multiplier * difficulty
- Verify final score makes sense
assert 150 <= final_score <= 600, f"Final score {final_score} unrealistic"
```

### Document Results

**If PASS:**
```markdown
### Correctness (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- All 3 features implement requirements correctly
- Cross-feature workflow (rank priority + Matchup → Final Score) correct
- Integration points produce correct data (verified with assertions)
- Edge cases tested: Missing rank data → graceful degradation
- Logic flow verified: Base score → rank multiplier → Matchup multiplier → Final score

**Issues Found:** None
```

**If FAIL:**
```markdown
### Correctness (Epic Level): ❌ FAIL

**Issues Found:**
- Issue #1: Feature 02 not applying rank multiplier correctly
- Root cause: Missing null check when rank data unavailable
- Error: Final score calculation incorrect (expected 300, got 450)

**Action Required:** Document issue, proceed to Step 7 (Handle Issues)
```

---

## Category 2: Code Quality (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Is code quality consistent across all features?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Code quality consistent across all features (same standards applied)
- [ ] No duplicate code between features that should be shared
- [ ] Abstractions appropriate for epic complexity
- [ ] Readability consistent across epic
- [ ] No feature has significantly lower quality than others

### How to Verify

```bash
- 1. Check for code duplication across features
- Look for similar functions/classes that should be extracted

- Example: Both Feature 01 and Feature 02 have `load_csv()` methods
- Should be extracted to utils/csv_utils.py

- 2. Review code complexity across features
- All features should have similar complexity levels

- 3. Check for inconsistent abstractions
- Example: Feature 01 uses classes, Feature 02 uses functions only
- Should be consistent (all classes or all functions)
```

### Common Issues

- Feature 01 uses detailed docstrings, Feature 02 has minimal docs → **Inconsistent**
- Feature 01 has 100-line functions, Feature 02 has 10-line functions → **Quality variance**
- Both features duplicate CSV loading code → **Should extract to utils**

### Document Results

```markdown
### Code Quality (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Code quality consistent across all 3 features
- Shared utilities extracted (csv_utils.py, error_handler.py)
- Abstractions consistent: All features use Manager classes
- Readability consistent: Same docstring style, naming conventions
- No features significantly lower quality

**Issues Found:** None
```

- [ ] Cross-feature interactions documented
- [ ] Integration points documented (interfaces, data flow)
- [ ] Epic success criteria documented
- [ ] User-facing documentation updated (if applicable)

### How to Verify

```markdown
- 1. Check EPIC_README.md completeness
- Epic overview present
- Feature list complete
- Integration points documented

- 2. Check integration point documentation
- Example: Feature 01 → Feature 02 interface

- In feature_01/README.md:
## Public Interfaces
- `get_rank_data(player_name: str) -> Tuple[float, int]`
  - Returns: (multiplier, priority_rank)
  - Used by: Feature 02 (Matchup System)
  - Contract: multiplier in [0.5, 1.5], rank > 0

- In feature_02/README.md:
## Dependencies
- Feature 01: Consumes `get_rank_data()` for rank multiplier
  - Expected: Tuple[float, int]
  - Fallback: If unavailable, uses default multiplier 1.0
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Comments & Documentation (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- EPIC_README.md complete (epic overview, feature list, integration points)
- Cross-feature interactions documented in both feature READMEs
- Integration points documented with contracts (types, ranges, fallbacks)
- Epic success criteria documented in epic_smoke_test_plan.md
- No user-facing docs needed (internal epic)

**Issues Found:** None
```

  └── lessons_learned.md

- Structure consistent? ✅

- 2. Check for shared utilities
- Both features load JSON data → Should use shared JSONLoader

- 3. Check for circular dependencies
- Feature 01 imports Feature 02 → Feature 02 imports Feature 01 → ❌ CIRCULAR
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Code Organization & Refactoring (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Feature folder structure consistent (same files in all features)
- Shared utilities extracted (utils/json_loader.py used by all features)
- Epic folder structure logical (features/, research/, EPIC_README.md)
- No DRY violations (checked for duplicate code)
- No circular dependencies (dependency graph is acyclic)

**Issues Found:** None
```

---

## Category 5: Testing (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Do epic-level integration tests exist and all tests pass?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Epic-level integration tests exist (test cross-feature scenarios)
- [ ] Cross-feature scenarios tested (not just individual features)
- [ ] All unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Test coverage adequate for epic (not just features)

- ============================== 2247 passed in 45.32s ===========================

- 2. Check for epic-level integration tests
- tests/integration/test_epic_integration.py should exist and test cross-feature workflows

- 3. Verify test coverage for integration points
- Coverage should include: Feature 01 → Feature 02 → Feature 03 flow
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Testing (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Epic-level integration tests exist (tests/integration/test_epic_integration.py)
- Cross-feature scenarios tested (rank priority + Matchup + Performance workflow)
- All 2247 unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Test coverage adequate: 92% overall, 87% for integration points

## Category 6: Security (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Are there security vulnerabilities in epic workflows?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in epic workflows
- [ ] Input validation consistent across features
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed (logs, error messages, outputs)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak internals
- [ ] File operations secure (no path traversal, injection)

### How to Verify

```python
- 1. Check input validation across features
- All features should validate inputs consistently

- Example: Feature 01 validates item names
def get_rank_data(player_name: str) -> Tuple[float, int]:
    if not player_name:
        raise ValueError("Item name required")
    if not isinstance(player_name, str):
        raise TypeError("Item name must be string")
    # ... proceed

- Feature 02 should validate similarly
def get_matchup_difficulty(player_name: str, week: int) -> float:
    if not player_name:
        raise ValueError("Item name required")  # ✅ Consistent
    if not isinstance(player_name, str):
        raise TypeError("Item name must be string")  # ✅ Consistent
    # ... proceed

- 2. Check for sensitive data leaks
- Error messages should not expose file paths, DB credentials, etc.

- 3. Check file operations
- Ensure no path traversal: player_name = "../../etc/passwd"
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Security (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- No security vulnerabilities identified in epic workflows
- Input validation consistent across all features (TypeError, ValueError for invalid inputs)
- No sensitive data exposed (checked logs, error messages, CSV outputs)
- Error messages user-friendly (no internal paths or stack traces)
- File operations secure (validated paths, no injection risks)

**Issues Found:** None
```

## Category 7: Performance (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Is epic performance acceptable and no regressions from baseline?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Epic performance acceptable (meets user expectations)
- [ ] No performance regressions from baseline (pre-epic)
- [ ] Cross-feature calls optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] No performance bottlenecks in integration points
- [ ] Performance tested with realistic data volumes

### How to Verify

```python
- 1. Measure epic-level performance
import time
start = time.time()

- Run epic workflow (e.g., draft with all features)
- python run_[module].py --mode draft --week 5 --iterations 10

end = time.time()
epic_time = end - start
print(f"Epic execution time: {epic_time:.2f}s")

- 2. Compare to baseline (pre-epic)
baseline_time = 2.5  # seconds (from S1 epic notes)
regression = (epic_time - baseline_time) / baseline_time * 100
print(f"Performance change: {regression:+.1f}%")

- Acceptable if: regression < 20% OR epic_time < 5s

- 3. Check for N+1 queries
- Example BAD: Loading rank data for each item in loop
for item in items:
    rank_data = get_rank_data(item.name)  # ❌ N queries

- Example GOOD: Batch load rank data
rank_data_map = get_all_rank_data()  # ✅ 1 query
for item in items:
    rank_data = rank_data_map.get(item.name)
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Performance (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Epic execution time: 3.2s (baseline: 2.5s, +28% regression)
- Regression acceptable: <5s threshold met
- Cross-feature calls optimized: Batch loading implemented for rank priority and Matchup data
- No N+1 queries identified
- Performance tested with 200 items (realistic volume)

**Performance Breakdown:**
- Feature 01 (rank priority): 0.8s
- Feature 02 (Matchup): 1.2s
- Feature 03 (Performance): 0.5s
- Integration overhead: 0.7s (acceptable)

**Issues Found:** None
```

**If Performance Issues:**
```markdown
### Performance (Epic Level): ❌ FAIL

**Issues Found:**
- Epic execution time: 12.5s (baseline: 2.5s, +400% regression)
- Root cause: N+1 queries in Feature 02 (loading matchup data per item)

**Action Required:** Create bug fix to batch load matchup data (proceed to Step 7)
```

---

## Category 8: Error Handling (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Is error handling consistent and do errors propagate correctly between features?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Error handling consistent across features (same error classes, patterns)
- [ ] Errors propagate correctly between features (not swallowed)
- [ ] User-facing errors helpful and actionable
- [ ] Epic degrades gracefully on errors (doesn't crash entire system)
- [ ] Error logging consistent (same format, level)

### How to Verify

```python
- 1. Check error class consistency
- Feature 01:
from utils.error_handler import DataProcessingError
raise DataProcessingError("rank data not found")

- Feature 02:
from utils.error_handler import DataProcessingError  # ✅ Same error class
raise DataProcessingError("Matchup data not found")

- 2. Check error propagation
- Feature 01 error should propagate to Feature 02
try:
    rank_data = get_rank_data("NonexistentPlayer")
except DataProcessingError as e:
    # Feature 02 should catch and handle
    logger.warning(f"rank priority unavailable: {e}")
    # Use default multiplier
    rank_data = (1.0, 999)

- 3. Check user-facing error messages
- GOOD: "Item 'J.Smith' not found in rank data. Using default ranking."
- BAD: "KeyError: 'John Doe' at line 342 in rank_manager.py"

- 4. Check graceful degradation
- If Feature 01 fails, Feature 02 should still work (with defaults)
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Error Handling (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Error handling consistent across features (all use DataProcessingError from utils.error_handler)
- Errors propagate correctly: Feature 01 errors caught by Feature 02, logged, and handled gracefully
- User-facing errors helpful: "Item not found in rank data. Using default ranking."
- Graceful degradation tested: Feature 01 failure doesn't crash epic (defaults used)
- Error logging consistent: All features use logger.warning() for non-critical errors

**Error Scenarios Tested:**
- Missing rank data → Default multiplier 1.0 used
- Missing matchup data → Default difficulty 1.0 used
- Invalid item name → Clear error message shown to user

**Issues Found:** None
```

---

## Category 9: Architecture (Epic Level - CRITICAL)

**Focus:** Is epic architecture coherent and design patterns applied consistently?

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CATEGORY FOR EPIC-LEVEL REVIEW**

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Epic architecture coherent (clear design, not ad-hoc)
- [ ] Feature separation appropriate (not too coupled, not too fragmented)
- [ ] Interfaces between features clean (well-defined contracts)
- [ ] No architectural inconsistencies (e.g., Feature 01 uses classes, Feature 02 uses functions)
- [ ] Design patterns applied consistently (e.g., Manager pattern, Factory pattern)
- [ ] Epic maintainable and extensible (easy to add features)

### How to Verify

```python
- 1. Check architectural consistency
- All features should follow same architectural pattern

- Feature 01:
class RankManager:
    def __init__(self, data_folder: Path):
        self.data_folder = data_folder

    def get_rank_data(self, player_name: str) -> Tuple[float, int]:
        # ...

- Feature 02:
class MatchupManager:  # ✅ Same Manager pattern
    def __init__(self, data_folder: Path):
        self.data_folder = data_folder

    def get_matchup_difficulty(self, player_name: str, week: int) -> float:
        # ...

- Feature 03:
class PerformanceTracker:  # ✅ Consistent
    def __init__(self, data_folder: Path):
        self.data_folder = data_folder

    def track_performance(self, player_name: str, actual_score: float):
        # ...

- 2. Check interface design
- Interfaces should be clean and well-defined

- GOOD:
def get_rank_data(player_name: str) -> Tuple[float, int]:
    """Clean interface: single responsibility, clear contract"""

- BAD:
def get_rank_data_and_maybe_matchup_if_available(player_name: str, week: Optional[int] = None) -> Union[float, Tuple[float, int], Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Unclear interface: multiple responsibilities, ambiguous return type"""

- 3. Check feature coupling
- Features should be loosely coupled (depend on interfaces, not implementations)

- GOOD: Feature 02 depends on interface
from feature_01.interfaces import IRankProvider
rank_provider: IRankProvider = get_rank_provider()
multiplier = rank_provider.get_multiplier("Record-A")

- BAD: Feature 02 depends on implementation
from feature_01.rank_manager import RankManager
rank_mgr = RankManager()  # ❌ Tightly coupled
multiplier = rank_mgr.get_rank_data("Record-A")[0]

- 4. Check design pattern consistency
- All features should use same patterns (Manager, Factory, Strategy, etc.)
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Architecture (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Epic architecture coherent: Manager pattern applied consistently across all features
- Feature separation appropriate: Each feature has single responsibility, clear boundaries
- Interfaces clean: All methods have clear contracts (type hints, docstrings)
- Architectural consistency: All features use Manager classes with same initialization pattern
- Design patterns consistent: Manager pattern for business logic, Factory pattern for object creation
- Maintainability: Easy to add new features (follow same Manager pattern)

**Architectural Patterns Identified:**
- Manager Pattern: RankManager, MatchupManager, PerformanceTracker
- Dependency Injection: Managers accept data_folder in __init__
- Error Context: All managers use error_handler.error_context()
- Graceful Degradation: Features provide defaults when dependencies unavailable

**Issues Found:** None
```

**If Architectural Issues:**
```markdown
### Architecture (Epic Level): ❌ FAIL

**Issues Found:**
- Architectural inconsistency: Feature 01 uses Manager class, Feature 02 uses standalone functions
- Tight coupling: Feature 02 directly imports Feature 01 implementation (not interface)
- Design pattern inconsistency: Feature 01 uses Factory pattern, Feature 02 has no pattern

**Action Required:** Create bug fix to refactor Feature 02 to Manager pattern (proceed to Step 7)
```

## Category 10: Backwards Compatibility (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Does epic break existing functionality?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Epic doesn't break existing functionality (pre-epic code still works)
- [ ] Migration path clear (if breaking changes necessary)
- [ ] Deprecated features handled correctly (warnings, docs)
- [ ] Version compatibility maintained (if applicable)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (not just new epic tests)

### How to Verify

```python
- 1. Run existing tests (pre-epic)
- All tests that existed before epic should still pass

python -m pytest tests/unit/test_record_manager.py -v
- All tests pass? ✅

- 2. Test existing workflows (pre-epic functionality)
- Epic should not break users who don't use new features

- Example: User runs draft without using new rank feature
python run_[module].py --mode draft --week 5
- Should still work as before epic? ✅

- 3. Check for breaking changes
- Example: Did epic change existing CSV column names?
- Before epic: 'score' column
- After epic: 'final_score' column ❌ BREAKING CHANGE

- 4. Check for deprecation warnings
- If deprecating old features, should warn user
import warnings
warnings.warn("Old rank priority format deprecated. Use new format.", DeprecationWarning)
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Backwards Compatibility (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Epic doesn't break existing functionality (all pre-epic tests pass)
- No breaking changes to existing APIs or data formats
- Existing workflows still work (draft mode without new features)
- No deprecated features in this epic
- Version compatibility maintained (no version bumps required)

**Backwards Compatibility Tests:**
- Existing unit tests: {N}/{N} passing ✅
- Existing integration tests: {M}/{M} passing ✅
- Pre-epic baseline workflow: Works without new features ✅
- Pre-epic CSV format: Unchanged (new columns added, not replaced) ✅

**Issues Found:** None
```

## Category 11: Scope & Changes (Epic Level)

**Focus:** Does epic scope match original request with no undocumented features?

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Epic scope matches original request (from `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt`)
- [ ] No scope creep (undocumented features added)
- [ ] All changes necessary for epic (no unrelated changes)
- [ ] No unrelated changes included (bug fixes, refactoring unrelated to epic)
- [ ] Epic goals achieved (validated in Validation Loop)

### How to Verify

```markdown
- 1. Re-read original epic request
- Read `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt`

- 2. Compare epic scope to original request
- Create validation table:

| Original Request | Implemented | Evidence | Scope Creep? |
|------------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Integrate rank data | ✅ YES | Feature 01 | NO |
| Add matchup projections | ✅ YES | Feature 02 | NO |
| Track performance | ✅ YES | Feature 03 | NO |
| (NOT requested: Refactor RecordManager) | ✅ YES | Code changes | ⚠️ YES - SCOPE CREEP |

- 3. Check for unrelated changes
- Example: Epic about recommendation engine but also refactored [domain analyzer] ❌

- 4. Verify all changes necessary
- Every code change should trace back to epic requirements
```

### Document Results

```markdown
### Scope & Changes (Epic Level): ✅ PASS

**Validated:**
- Epic scope matches original request (3 features requested, 3 features delivered)
- No scope creep identified (no undocumented features)
- All changes necessary for epic (traced back to requirements)
- No unrelated changes (no bug fixes or refactoring outside epic scope)
