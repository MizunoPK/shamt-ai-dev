## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ MISTAKE 1: "Repeating feature-level PR review at epic level"

**Why this is wrong:**
- S7 already did feature-level PR review for each feature
- S9.P4 focuses on EPIC-WIDE concerns (cross-feature impacts)
- Repeating feature-level checks wastes time

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Focus on epic-wide architectural consistency
- ✅ Review cross-feature impacts (not individual features)
- ✅ Validate design patterns applied consistently
- ✅ Check for duplicated code BETWEEN features (not within)

**Example:**
```text
BAD: Reviewing Feature 01's code quality in isolation
GOOD: Comparing code quality ACROSS all features (consistency check)

BAD: Checking if Feature 01 has unit tests
GOOD: Checking if epic-level integration tests exist (cross-feature scenarios)
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 2: "Fixing issues inline and continuing S9"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Bug fixes may affect areas already checked in S9
- Cannot assume previous QC results still valid
- Partial S9 completion creates gaps in validation

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Document ALL issues in epic_lessons_learned.md
- ✅ Create bug fixes using bug fix workflow (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)
- ✅ COMPLETELY RESTART S9 after fixes (from S9.P1)
- ✅ Re-run ALL steps (smoke testing, QC 1-3, PR review)

**Example:**
```bash
BAD:
- Find architectural issue in Step 6.9
- Fix it with quick code change
- Continue to Step 8 (Final Verification)

GOOD:
- Find architectural issue in Step 6.9
- Document in epic_lessons_learned.md
- Create bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency/
- Run bug fix through S2 → S5 → S6 → S7
- RESTART S9 from S9.P1 (smoke testing)
- Re-run S9.P1, S9.P2, S9.P3, S9.P4 (all steps)
- Only then proceed to S10
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 3: "Skipping Architecture category review"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Architecture (Step 6.9) is the MOST IMPORTANT category for epic-level review
- Architectural inconsistencies cause long-term maintainability issues
- Missing this check means shipping brittle epic

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Spend EXTRA time on Architecture category (Step 6.9)
- ✅ Verify design patterns consistent across ALL features
- ✅ Check for architectural inconsistencies (Manager vs functions, classes vs modules)
- ✅ Validate interfaces between features are clean

**Example:**
```text
BAD:
✅ Correctness: PASS
✅ Code Quality: PASS
✅ Architecture: PASS (didn't check, assumed consistent)

GOOD:
✅ Correctness: PASS (verified cross-feature workflows)
✅ Code Quality: PASS (checked consistency across features)
✅ Architecture: PASS (verified Manager pattern used in ALL features)
  - Feature 01: RankManager ✅
  - Feature 02: MatchupManager ✅
  - Feature 03: PerformanceTracker ✅
  - Design pattern: Manager pattern used consistently ✅
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 4: "Comparing to specs instead of original epic request"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Specs evolved during implementation (may have scope creep)
- Specs may have deviated from user's original vision
- Step 6.11 (Scope & Changes) validates against USER'S GOALS, not intermediate specs

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Re-read ORIGINAL `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt` file
- ✅ Validate against user's stated goals (from epic notes)
- ✅ Verify expected outcomes delivered (from user's perspective)
- ✅ Check for scope creep (features not in original request)

**Example:**
```text
BAD:
- Check if Feature 01 matches feature_01/spec.md ✅
- Mark Scope & Changes as PASS

GOOD:
- Re-read add_json_export_format.txt
- User requested: "Export records as JSON" ✅
- User requested: "Support configurable output path" ✅
- User requested: "Track export history" ✅
- Epic delivered all 3 ✅
- No undocumented features added ✅
- Mark Scope & Changes as PASS
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 5: "Accepting low priority issues instead of creating bug fixes"

**Why this is wrong:**
- "Low priority" issues accumulate and degrade epic quality
- Architectural inconsistencies labeled "low" are often HIGH impact
- Deferring issues means they may never get fixed

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Use priority determination correctly:
  - **HIGH:** Breaks functionality, security, architecture, performance >100% regression
  - **MEDIUM:** Affects quality (consistency, error messages, minor performance)
  - **LOW:** Cosmetic only (comments, variable names)
- ✅ Create bug fixes for HIGH and MEDIUM issues
- ✅ Only defer LOW issues (truly cosmetic)

**Example:**
```text
BAD:
Issue: Feature 01 uses Manager pattern, Feature 02 uses functions
Priority: low (it works, just inconsistent)
Action: Document, don't fix

GOOD:
Issue: Feature 01 uses Manager pattern, Feature 02 uses functions
Priority: HIGH (architectural inconsistency, maintainability impact)
Action: Create bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 6: "Not documenting PR review results"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Future agents can't see what was reviewed
- Can't prove epic was thoroughly reviewed
- Lessons learned lost (can't improve process)

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Document PR review results in epic_lessons_learned.md (Step 6.12)
- ✅ Include: Date, reviewer, epic name, all 12 categories, status, notes
- ✅ If issues found: Document issues, bug fixes created, restart log
- ✅ Update EPIC_README.md with review completion

**Example:**
```text
BAD:
- Complete PR review mentally
- Mark Step 6 as complete
- Proceed to Step 8

GOOD:
- Complete PR review (all 12 categories)
- Document results in epic_lessons_learned.md:
  ## S9.P4 - Epic PR Review (12 Categories)
  **Date:** 2025-01-02
  **Overall Status:** ✅ APPROVED
  **Issues Found:** 0
- Update EPIC_README.md: "Epic PR review: ✅ PASSED"
- Proceed to Step 8
```

---

### ❌ MISTAKE 7: "Proceeding to S10 with pending issues"

**Why this is wrong:**
- S10 is final cleanup (commits, PR creation, merge to main); S11 handles archival (move to done/)
- Cannot commit epic with known issues
- User will find issues after "completion"

**What to do instead:**
- ✅ Verify NO pending issues before Step 8 (Final Verification)
- ✅ All bug fixes must be COMPLETE (S7)
- ✅ S9 must be RESTARTED after bug fixes
- ✅ Only proceed to S10 when verification checklist 100% complete

**Example:**
```bash
BAD:
Step 8.1: Verification Checklist
- ✅ Epic smoke testing passed
- ✅ QC rounds passed
- ✅ Epic PR review passed
- ⚠️ 1 pending bug fix (bugfix_high_performance - S6)
- ✅ Tests passing
→ Proceed to S10 anyway

GOOD:
Step 8.1: Verification Checklist
- ✅ Epic smoke testing passed
- ✅ QC rounds passed
- ✅ Epic PR review passed
- ⚠️ 1 pending bug fix (bugfix_high_performance - S6)
→ STOP - Cannot proceed
→ Complete bug fix (finish S7)
→ RESTART S9 from S9.P1
→ Re-run all steps
→ Re-verify checklist (all items ✅)
→ Then proceed to S10
```

## Real-World Example

### Example: Epic Final Review for "Improve Draft Helper" Epic

**Context:**
- Epic: Improve Draft Helper
- Features: 3 (rank priority Integration, Matchup System, Performance Tracking)
- S9.P1 complete: Epic smoke testing passed
- S9.P2 complete: Validation Loop passed (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
- Now starting S9.P4: Epic Final Review

---

**STEP 6: Epic PR Review (12 Categories)**

**Step 6.1: Correctness (Epic Level)**

```python
## Verify cross-feature workflow correctness
from feature_01.rank_manager import RankManager
from feature_02.matchup_manager import MatchupManager
from [module].util.DataRecord import DataRecord

## Test integration correctness
rank_mgr = RankManager(data_folder=Path("data"))
matchup_mgr = MatchupManager(data_folder=Path("data"))

item = DataRecord("Record-A", "QB", 300.0)
rank_mult, priority_rank = rank_mgr.get_rank_data("Record-A")
matchup_diff = matchup_mgr.get_matchup_difficulty("Record-A", week=5)

final_score = item.score * rank_mult * matchup_diff
## Verify: 300 * 1.2 * 0.9 = 324
assert 320 <= final_score <= 330, "Integration calculation incorrect"
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS (all cross-feature workflows correct)

---

**Step 6.9: Architecture (Epic Level - CRITICAL)**

```python
## Check architectural consistency
## Feature 01:
class RankManager:  # ✅ Manager pattern
    def __init__(self, data_folder: Path):
        self.data_folder = data_folder

## Feature 02:
def get_matchup_difficulty(player_name: str, week: int) -> float:  # ❌ Standalone function
    # ...

## Feature 03:
class PerformanceTracker:  # ✅ Manager pattern
    def __init__(self, data_folder: Path):
        self.data_folder = data_folder
```

**Result:** ❌ FAIL - Architectural inconsistency

**Issue:** Feature 02 uses standalone functions instead of Manager pattern

---

**Step 6.12: Document PR Review Results**

```markdown
## S9.P4 - Epic PR Review (12 Categories)

**Date:** 2025-01-02
**Reviewer:** Claude Agent

| 9. Architecture | ❌ FAIL | Feature 02 uses functions instead of Manager pattern |
| 10. Compatibility | ✅ PASS | No breaking changes |
| 11. Scope | ✅ PASS | Matches original request |

**Overall Status:** ❌ REJECTED

**Issues Found:** 1

**Issue 1: Architectural Inconsistency (Category 9: Architecture)**
- Feature 01 and 03 use Manager pattern, Feature 02 uses standalone functions
- Impact: HIGH - Architectural inconsistency
- Fix Required: Refactor Feature 02 to MatchupManager class

**Next Action:** Create bug fix, then RESTART S9
```

---

**STEP 7: Handle Issues**

**Step 7.1: Document Issues**

```markdown
## S9.P4 Issues Found

**Date:** 2025-01-02

**Issue 1: Architectural Inconsistency in Feature 02**
- **Discovered In:** Step 6.9 (Epic PR Review - Architecture)
- **Description:** Feature 02 uses standalone functions, Features 01 and 03 use Manager pattern
- **Impact:** HIGH - Architectural inconsistency makes epic hard to maintain
- **Root Cause:** Different implementation approach for Feature 02
- **Fix Required:** Refactor Feature 02 to MatchupManager class
- **Priority:** high
```

**Step 7.2: Determine Priority**

```markdown
## Issue Prioritization

**HIGH priority (create bug fixes now):**
- Issue 1: Architectural inconsistency → bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency
```

**Step 7.3: Present to User**

```markdown
I found 1 issue during S9.P4 Epic PR Review that requires a bug fix:

**ISSUE 1: Architectural Inconsistency (HIGH priority)**
- **Problem:** Feature 02 uses standalone functions instead of Manager pattern
- **Impact:** Architectural inconsistency makes epic hard to maintain
- **Fix:** Refactor Feature 02 to MatchupManager class
- **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)

After fixing, I'll RESTART S9 from S9.P1.

Should I proceed?
```

**Step 7.4: Create Bug Fix**

```text
bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency/
├── notes.txt ("Refactor Feature 02 to Manager pattern")
├── spec.md (bug fix specification)
├── implementation_plan.md (refactoring tasks)
└── lessons_learned.md (what we learned)
```

**Run through:** S2 → S5 → S6 → S7 (bug fix complete)

**Step 7.5: RESTART S9**

```markdown
## S9 Restart Log

**Restart Date:** 2025-01-02
**Reason:** 1 bug fix completed (bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency)

**Bug Fix:** Refactored Feature 02 to MatchupManager class

**Restart Actions:**
- Re-ran S9.P1: Epic Smoke Testing (all 4 parts) - PASSED
- Re-ran S9.P2: Validation Loop (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation) - PASSED
- Re-ran S9.P3: User Testing - PASSED
- Re-ran S9.P4: Epic PR Review (all 12 categories) - PASSED
  - Architecture category now PASSED (all features use Manager pattern)

**Result:** S9 complete after restart (no new issues)
```
