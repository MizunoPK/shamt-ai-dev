## Sub-Stage Summary Table

| Sub-Stage | Steps | Time | Key Activities | Mandatory Gates |
|-----------|-------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| S9.P1 | 1-2 | 60-90 min | Pre-QC verification, Epic smoke testing (4 parts) | Part 4 data values |
| S9.P2 | 3-5 | 2-3 hrs | Epic QC Validation Loop (integration, consistency, success criteria) | Primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation |

## Mandatory Restart Protocol 🔄

**CRITICAL:** If ANY issues found during S9:

### Restart Steps:
1. **Create bug fix** using bug fix workflow (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)
2. **RESTART S9 from S9.P1** (cannot partially continue)
3. **Re-run ALL 8 steps:**
   - S9.P1: Epic Smoke Testing (all 4 parts)
   - S9.P2: Validation Loop (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
   - S9.P3: Epic PR Review (all 11 categories)
4. **Document restart** in epic_lessons_learned.md

### Why COMPLETE Restart?
- Bug fixes may have affected areas already checked
- Cannot assume previous QC results still valid
- Ensures epic-level quality maintained

**Cannot proceed to S10 without passing S9 restart.**

## Epic vs Feature Testing Differences

### Feature-Level Testing (S7)
**Focus:** Individual feature in ISOLATION
**Tests:**
- Smoke testing: Part 1-3 (Import, Entry Point, E2E)
- QC rounds: Feature-specific validation
- PR review: Single feature scope

**Scope:** One feature at a time

### Epic-Level Testing (S9)
**Focus:** All features working TOGETHER as system
**Tests:**
- Smoke testing: Part 1-4 (adds Cross-Feature Integration)
- QC rounds: Cross-feature integration, epic cohesion, success criteria
- PR review: Epic-wide architectural consistency

**Scope:** Entire epic as cohesive whole

---

## S9 Critical Rules

- ✅ ALWAYS use EVOLVED epic_smoke_test_plan.md (not original from S1)
- ✅ Verify DATA VALUES, not just file existence
- ✅ Epic-level validation focuses on INTEGRATION (not individual features)
- ✅ Epic QC Validation Loop is MANDATORY (primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation)
- ✅ If ANY issues found → create bug fix → RESTART S9 from S9.P1
- ✅ Epic PR review has 11 categories (all mandatory, Architecture MOST IMPORTANT)
- ✅ Validate against ORIGINAL epic request (re-read `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt`)
- ✅ 100% test pass rate required throughout S9
- ✅ Zero tolerance for epic-level quality issues

---

## Epic Smoke Testing Parts (Step 2)

### Part 1: Import Test
**What:** All epic features import successfully
**Commands:** Import each feature module
**Pass:** No import errors

### Part 2: Entry Point Test
**What:** Main entry points work
**Commands:** Run main scripts (run_[module].py, etc.)
**Pass:** Scripts execute without errors

### Part 3: E2E Execution Test
**What:** End-to-end workflows with DATA VALUE verification
**Commands:** Run epic_smoke_test_plan.md scenarios
**Pass:** Correct data values in outputs (not just file existence)

### Part 4: Cross-Feature Integration Test ← MANDATORY GATE
**What:** Features work TOGETHER
**Commands:** Integration scenarios from epic_smoke_test_plan.md
**Pass:** Data flows between features correctly

**If FAIL:** Fix issues, restart from Part 1

---

## Epic-Specific Validation Dimensions (8-13)

### Dimension 8: Cross-Feature Integration
**Check:**
- Integration points tested (features communicate correctly)
- Data flow verification (data passed correctly between features)
- Interface compatibility (features use correct interfaces)
- Error propagation (errors handled across features)

**Pass Criteria:** All integration points working, no cross-feature errors

### Dimension 9: Data Flow Validation
**Check:**
- Data flows correctly between all features
- No data corruption at integration points
- Correct data types and formats

**Pass Criteria:** Data integrity maintained across features

### Dimension 10: Epic Cohesion & Consistency
**Check:**
- Code style consistency (same style across all features)
- Naming conventions alignment (consistent naming)
- Error handling patterns (same error handling approach)
- Architectural patterns (consistent architecture)

**Pass Criteria:** Epic is cohesive, no inconsistencies

### Dimension 11: Error Propagation
**Check:**
- Errors propagate correctly across feature boundaries
- Error handling is consistent
- User-facing error messages are appropriate

**Pass Criteria:** Error handling works end-to-end

### Dimension 12: End-to-End Success Criteria
**Check:**
- Original epic goals validated (re-read epic request)
- ALL success criteria met (100% - defined in epic_smoke_test_plan.md)
- UX flow validated (user workflows work end-to-end)
- Performance benchmarks met (no regressions >100%)

**Pass Criteria:** 100% of success criteria met, user goals achieved

### Dimension 13: Mechanical Code Quality (Epic-Wide)
**Check:**
- Linter-type issues checked across ALL features (unused imports, dead code, etc.)
- Consistent code style across all features
- No debug statements left in
- Security quick scan passed (no eval, SQL concat, path traversal)

**Pass Criteria:** Zero linter errors, consistent patterns across all features

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, reset `consecutive_clean`, continue validation

## Epic PR Review Categories (Step 6)

### 11 Mandatory Categories:
1. **Architecture** ← MOST IMPORTANT (epic-wide patterns, consistency)
2. Code Quality (readability, maintainability)
3. Security (no vulnerabilities across epic)
4. Error Handling (consistent error patterns)
5. Performance (no regressions >100%)
6. Testing (integration test coverage)
7. Documentation (epic-wide docs)
8. Configuration (config consistency)
9. Dependencies (no conflicts)
10. Logging (consistent logging patterns)
11. User Experience (epic-wide UX flow)

**Pass Criteria:** ALL 11 categories PASSED
**If FAIL:** Create bug fix → RESTART S9.P1

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Using Original Test Plan (S1)
**Problem:** "I'll use the epic_smoke_test_plan.md from S1"
**Impact:** Test plan is outdated (assumptions, not reality)
**Solution:** Use EVOLVED test plan (updated in S3.P1 if testing approach requires it, then S8.P2)

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Only Checking File Existence
**Problem:** "File exists, so test passed"
**Impact:** File has incorrect data, bugs escape to S10
**Solution:** Verify DATA VALUES (not just file existence)

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Skipping Validation Loop
**Problem:** "Smoke testing passed, I'll skip validation"
**Impact:** Quality issues slip through, fail in user testing
**Solution:** Validation Loop with primary clean round + sub-agent confirmation is MANDATORY

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Inline Bug Fixes
**Problem:** "Small bug, I'll fix it inline without bug fix workflow"
**Impact:** No documentation, fix not properly tested, may break other areas
**Solution:** Create bug fix using bug fix workflow, RESTART S9.P1

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Partial Restart After Bug Fix
**Problem:** "I'll just re-run the QC round that failed"
**Impact:** Bug fix may have affected other areas, incomplete validation
**Solution:** COMPLETE restart from S9.P1 (all 8 steps)

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Feature-Level Focus
**Problem:** Testing features individually instead of together
**Impact:** Integration bugs slip through
**Solution:** Focus on cross-feature workflows and integration points

### ❌ Pitfall 7: Ignoring Original Epic Request
**Problem:** "I'll validate against final specs, not original request"
**Impact:** Scope creep validated, original goals missed
**Solution:** Re-read `.shamt/epics/requests/{epic_name}.txt`, validate against user's original intent
