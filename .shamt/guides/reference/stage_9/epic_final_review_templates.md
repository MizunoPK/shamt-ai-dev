```

### Example (Multiple Issues)

```markdown
## S9.P3 Issues Found

**Date:** 2025-01-02

**Issue 1: Architectural Inconsistency**
- **Discovered In:** Step 6.9 (Epic PR Review - Architecture)
- **Description:** Feature 01 uses Manager class pattern, Feature 02 uses standalone functions
- **Impact:** HIGH - Architectural inconsistency makes epic hard to maintain
- **Root Cause:** Different agents implemented features with different patterns
- **Fix Required:** Refactor Feature 02 to Manager pattern (MatchupManager class)
- **Priority:** high

**Issue 2: Performance Regression**
- **Discovered In:** Step 6.7 (Epic PR Review - Performance)
- **Description:** Epic execution time 12.5s (baseline 2.5s, +400% regression)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Unacceptable performance for user

- **Fix Required:** Implement batch loading for matchup data
- **Priority:** high

**Issue 3: Inconsistent Error Messages**
- **Discovered In:** Step 6.8 (Epic PR Review - Error Handling)
- **Description:** Feature 01 uses "Item not found", Feature 02 uses "No record data"
- **Impact:** LOW - User confusion but not functional
- **Root Cause:** Different error message templates
- **Fix Required:** Standardize error messages to "Item '{name}' not found in {feature} data"
- **Priority:** medium
```

---

## Template 3: Issue Prioritization (Step 7.2)

**Purpose:** Determine which issues require bug fixes vs documentation only
**When to Use:** After documenting all issues in Step 7.1
**Location:** Add to `SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/epic_lessons_learned.md` or work notes

### Template

```markdown
## Issue Prioritization

**HIGH priority (create bug fixes now):**
- Issue {N}: {Brief description} → bugfix_high_{name}
- Issue {N}: {Brief description} → bugfix_high_{name}

**MEDIUM priority (create bug fixes after high):**
- Issue {N}: {Brief description} → bugfix_medium_{name}

**LOW priority (document only, no bug fix):**
- Issue {N}: {Brief description} (documented for future improvement)
```

### Priority Guidelines

**HIGH Priority - Create Bug Fix Immediately:**
- Issue breaks epic functionality OR unacceptable quality
- Epic won't work correctly
- User-facing failures
- Architectural inconsistencies
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance regressions >100%

**MEDIUM Priority - Create Bug Fix After High:**
- Issue affects quality but not functionality
- Inconsistencies (error messages, code style)
- Minor performance issues (<100% regression)
- Incomplete documentation

**LOW Priority - Document Only:**
- Issue is cosmetic or minor
- Code style nitpicks
- Optional refactoring
- Nice-to-have improvements

### Example

```markdown
## Issue Prioritization

**HIGH priority (create bug fixes now):**
- Issue 1: Architectural inconsistency → bugfix_high_architecture_inconsistency
- Issue 2: Performance regression → bugfix_high_performance_regression

**MEDIUM priority (create bug fixes after high):**
- Issue 3: Inconsistent error messages → bugfix_medium_error_messages

**LOW priority (document only, no bug fix):**
- None identified
```

---

## Template 4: User Presentation (Step 7.3)

**Purpose:** Present issues to user for approval before creating bug fixes
**When to Use:** After prioritizing issues, before creating bug fixes
**Format:** Present directly to user (not in a file)

### Template

```markdown
I found {number} issues during S9.P3 Epic PR Review that require bug fixes:

**ISSUE 1: {Issue Name} ({PRIORITY} priority)**
- **Problem:** {Brief description of the issue}
- **Impact:** {Why it matters}
- **Fix:** {What will be done}
- **Estimated time:** {X-Y hours (bug fix workflow: S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)}

**ISSUE 2: {Issue Name} ({PRIORITY} priority)**
- **Problem:** {Brief description of the issue}
- **Impact:** {Why it matters}
- **Fix:** {What will be done}
- **Estimated time:** {X-Y hours}

[Repeat for all high/medium priority issues]

After fixing these issues, I'll need to RESTART S9 from the beginning (S9.P1 smoke testing) to ensure the fixes didn't introduce new issues.

Should I proceed with creating these bug fixes?
```

### Example

```markdown
I found 2 issues during S9.P3 Epic PR Review that require bug fixes:

**ISSUE 1: Architectural Inconsistency (HIGH priority)**
- **Problem:** Feature 01 uses Manager class pattern, Feature 02 uses standalone functions
- **Impact:** Architectural inconsistency makes epic hard to maintain
- **Fix:** Refactor Feature 02 to Manager pattern (MatchupManager class)
- **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours (bug fix workflow: S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)

**ISSUE 2: Performance Regression (HIGH priority)**
- **Problem:** Epic execution time 12.5s (baseline 2.5s, +400% regression)
- **Impact:** Unacceptable performance for user
- **Fix:** Implement batch loading for matchup data in Feature 02
- **Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

After fixing these issues, I'll need to RESTART S9 from the beginning (S9.P1 smoke testing) to ensure the fixes didn't introduce new issues.

Should I proceed with creating these bug fixes?
```

**Wait for user approval before proceeding to Step 7.4.**

### Example

```markdown
## S9.P3 Lessons Learned (Epic Final Review)

**Date:** 2025-01-02

**What Went Well:**
- Epic PR review systematic (11 categories covered comprehensively)
- Architectural consistency check caught Manager pattern inconsistency
- Performance category identified N+1 query regression early
- Bug fix workflow smooth (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)
- S9 restart after bug fixes ensured quality maintained

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Architectural pattern should be enforced in S2 (spec should mandate Manager pattern)
- Performance baseline should be measured in S1 (not assumed)
- Could have caught architectural inconsistency in S8.P1 (cross-feature alignment)

**Issues Found & Resolved:**
1. **Architectural Inconsistency:** Feature 02 used standalone functions instead of Manager pattern
   - Fixed: Refactored to MatchupManager class
   - Prevention: Add "Architecture Pattern" to S2 spec template
2. **Performance Regression:** N+1 queries in Feature 02 (+400% regression)
   - Fixed: Implemented batch loading for matchup data
   - Prevention: Add performance testing to S7 smoke testing

**Insights for Future Epics:**
- Establish architectural patterns early (S2 deep dives)
- Document patterns in EPIC_README.md for all agents to follow
- Measure performance baseline in S1 (include in epic notes)
- Add "Architecture" section to feature spec.md template
- Review architectural consistency after EACH feature (S8.P1)

**Guide Improvements Needed:**
- STAGE_2 guide: Add "Architecture Pattern" section to spec template
- S7.P1 guide: Add performance baseline comparison to smoke testing
- S9 guide: Add architectural pattern consistency check

**S9.P3 Statistics:**
- Epic PR Review time: 45 minutes
- Issues found: 2 (both high priority)
- Bug fixes created: 2
- Bug fix time: 4 hours total
- S9 restart time: 2 hours
- Total S9 time: 8.5 hours (including restarts)

**Key Takeaway:** Epic-level PR review is CRITICAL for catching architectural inconsistencies that feature-level reviews miss. The 11-category checklist provides comprehensive coverage.
