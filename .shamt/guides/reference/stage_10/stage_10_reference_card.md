# STAGE 10: Epic Cleanup - Quick Reference Card

**Purpose:** One-page summary for final epic completion and archival
**Use Case:** Quick lookup when committing changes and archiving epic
**Total Time:** 40-80 minutes (includes S10.P1 guide updates)
**Note:** User testing completed in S9 (Step 6) before S10 begins

## Workflow Overview

```text
STEP 1: Pre-Cleanup Verification (5 min)
    ├─ Verify S9 complete
    ├─ Verify all features complete (S8.P2)
    ├─ Verify no pending work
    └─ Read epic_lessons_learned.md
    ↓
STEP 2: Run Unit Tests (5-10 min) ← MANDATORY GATE
    ├─ Execute: {TEST_COMMAND}
    ├─ Verify exit code 0 (all tests passing - 100%)
    └─ If ANY tests fail → Fix and re-run
    ↓
STEP 3: Documentation Verification (5-10 min)
    ├─ Verify EPIC_README.md complete
    ├─ Verify epic_lessons_learned.md contains insights
    ├─ Verify epic_smoke_test_plan.md accurate
    ├─ Verify all feature README.md files complete
    └─ Update any incomplete documentation
    ↓
STEP 4: Guide Update from Lessons Learned (20-45 min) ← S10.P1 MANDATORY
    ├─ Read stages/s10/s10_p1_guide_update_workflow.md (complete 9-step process)
    ├─ Analyze ALL lessons_learned.md files (epic + features)
    ├─ Create GUIDE_UPDATE_PROPOSAL.md (prioritized P0-P3)
    ├─ Present EACH proposal to user (individual approval)
    ├─ User decides: Approve / Modify / Reject / Discuss
    ├─ Apply only approved changes to guides
    ├─ Create separate commit for guide updates
    └─ Update guide_update_tracking.md
    ↓
STEP 5: Final Commit & Pull Request (5-10 min)
    ├─ Review changes (git status, git diff)
    ├─ Stage all epic-related changes
    ├─ Create commit: "{commit_type}/SHAMT-{number}: {message}"
    ├─ Push branch to remote (git push origin {work_type}/SHAMT-{number})
    ├─ Create Pull Request using gh CLI
    ├─ Wait for user to review and merge PR
    └─ Update .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md after user merges
    ↓
STEP 6: Move Epic to done/ Folder (2 min)
    ├─ Create done/ folder if doesn't exist
    ├─ Move entire epic folder: mv {epic}/ done/{epic}/
    ├─ Verify move successful
    └─ Leave original epic request (.txt) in .shamt/epics/requests/
    ↓
STEP 7: Final Verification & Completion (2 min)
    ├─ Verify epic in done/ folder
    ├─ Verify git clean state
    ├─ Update EPIC_README.md with completion summary
    └─ Epic COMPLETE! 🎉

## Step Summary Table

| Step | Duration | Key Activities | Mandatory Gate? |
|------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 5 min | Pre-cleanup verification | No |
| 2 | 5-10 min | Run unit tests (100% pass) | ✅ YES |
| 3 | 5-10 min | Documentation verification | No |
| 4 | 20-45 min | Guide updates (S10.P1, user approval) | No |
| 5 | 5-10 min | Final commit, create PR, merge | No |
| 6 | 2 min | Move epic to done/ | No |
| 7 | 2 min | Final verification | No |

**Note:** User testing was moved to S9 (Step 6) - S10 only begins after user testing passes with zero bugs.

---

## Mandatory Gates (1 Required in S10)

### Gate 1: Unit Tests - 100% Pass (Step 2)
**Location:** stages/s10/s10_epic_cleanup.md Step 2
**What it checks:**
- All unit tests passing
- Exit code = 0
- No test failures
- No skipped tests

**Pass Criteria:** 100% test pass rate
**If FAIL:** Fix failing tests, re-run until 100% pass

**Command:**
```bash
{TEST_COMMAND}
```

**Why mandatory:** Cannot commit code with failing tests

**Note:** User Testing (formerly Gate 2) has been moved to S9 (Step 6). S10 only begins after user testing passes with ZERO bugs.

---

## Prerequisites from S9

### User Testing Already Complete
**Location:** stages/s9/s9_p4_epic_final_review.md Step 6
**What was checked:**
- User tested complete system themselves
- User reported ZERO bugs
- All previous bugs fixed and S9 re-run

**Verified before S10:** User testing passed with ZERO bugs

**If bugs found in S9:**
- Create bug fixes (S2 → S5 → S6 → S7)
- RESTART S9 from S9.P1 (Epic Smoke Testing)
- Re-run all S9 steps (6a → S9.P2 → S9.P3)
- User re-tests in S9 Step 6
- Only proceed to S10 after user approval (ZERO bugs)

---

## Commit Message Format

### Required Format:
```json
{commit_type}/SHAMT-{number}: {message}

{body}
```

### Commit Type:
- `feat` - Feature work (most epic commits)
- `fix` - Bug fix work

**Note:** Use `feat` for epic commits (NOT `epic`, even for epic branches)

### Message:
- 100 characters or less
- Imperative mood ("Add", "Update", not "Added", "Updated")
- No emojis
- Brief summary of epic

### Body:
Three sections (Major features, Key changes, Testing):
- Keep concise (5-10 lines total)

### Example:
```text
feat/SHAMT-1: Add ADP integration and projection system to draft helper

Major features:
- Integrate ADP data from FantasyPros API
- Add injury assessment to player projections
- Implement schedule strength analysis

Key changes:
- player_data_fetcher.py: Add ADP API integration
- projection_engine.py: Add injury/schedule multipliers

Testing:
- All unit tests passing (2200/2200)
- Epic smoke testing passed
- Epic QC Validation Loop passed
```

## Git Workflow (Step 6)

### 6.1: Review Changes
```bash
git status       # See all modified files
git diff         # See all changes
```

### 6.2: Stage Changes
```bash
git add .shamt/epics/SHAMT-{N}-{epic_name}/
git add <any other changed files>
```

### 6.3: Commit
```bash
git commit -m "{commit_type}/SHAMT-{number}: {message}"
```

### 6.4: Push Branch to Remote
```bash
git push origin {work_type}/SHAMT-{number}
```

### 6.5: Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create --base main --head {work_type}/SHAMT-{number} \
  --title "{commit_type}/SHAMT-{number}: Complete {epic_name} epic" \
  --body "{Epic summary, features, tests, review instructions}"
```

See USER_PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md for user review options.

### 6.6: Wait for User to Merge PR
Agent waits for user to review and merge the Pull Request in GitHub.

### 6.7: Update .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md (After User Merges)
- Pull latest: git checkout main && git pull origin main
- Move epic from Active to Completed table
- Add epic detail section
- Increment "Next Available Number"
- Commit and push .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md

## Critical Rules Summary

- ✅ S9 MUST be complete before S10
- ✅ Run unit tests BEFORE committing (100% pass required)
- ✅ Verify ALL documentation complete
- ✅ User testing is MANDATORY (BEFORE commit)
- ✅ Commit message must use new format ({commit_type}/SHAMT-{number})
- ✅ Push branch and create PR for user review
- ✅ Wait for user to review and merge PR
- ✅ Update .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md AFTER user merges
- ✅ Move ENTIRE epic folder (not individual features)
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md if guides improved
- ✅ Verify epic is TRULY complete

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Skipping User Testing
**Problem:** "All tests pass, I'll skip user testing"
**Impact:** User finds bugs in production, rework required
**Solution:** User testing is MANDATORY (Step 5), cannot skip

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Committing with Failing Tests
**Problem:** "I'll fix the tests later"
**Impact:** Broken code in git history, tests always fail
**Solution:** 100% test pass BEFORE commit (Step 2 gate)

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Not Applying Lessons Learned
**Problem:** "I'll skip updating guides, the lessons are documented"
**Impact:** Future agents repeat same mistakes, guides don't improve
**Solution:** Apply ALL lessons from ALL sources (Step 4, 100% application)

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Committing with Bugs from User Testing
**Problem:** "User found a small bug, I'll commit and fix later"
**Impact:** Known bugs in production, tech debt
**Solution:** Fix ALL bugs → RESTART S9 → Get ZERO bugs from user

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Vague Commit Message
**Problem:** "feat/SHAMT-1: Add features"
**Impact:** Git history unclear, future agents can't understand changes
**Solution:** Descriptive message (100 chars), list major features in body

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Moving Individual Features
**Problem:** "I'll move each feature folder separately"
**Impact:** Epic split across locations, hard to find complete epic
**Solution:** Move ENTIRE epic folder at once

### ❌ Pitfall 7: Not Updating .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md
**Problem:** "I'll update EPIC_TRACKER later"
**Impact:** Active epics list out of date, SHAMT number conflicts
**Solution:** Update .shamt/epics/EPIC_TRACKER.md immediately after merge (Step 6.6)
