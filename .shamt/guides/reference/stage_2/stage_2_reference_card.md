## Mandatory Gates

### Gate 1: Phase 1.5 - Research Completeness Audit
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md
**What it checks:**
- Component Research: Have you found the code mentioned in epic?
- Pattern Research: Have you studied similar features?
- Data Research: Have you located data sources?
- Discovery Context Knowledge: Did you review DISCOVERY.md during research?

**Pass Criteria:** ALL 4 categories answered with evidence (file paths, line numbers)
**If FAIL:** Return to Phase 1, research gaps, re-run audit

### Gate 2: Phase 2.5 - Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p2_specification.md
**What it checks:**
- Scope Creep: Requirements NOT in epic notes
- Missing Requirements: Epic requests NOT in spec

**Pass Criteria:** Zero scope creep + zero missing requirements
**If FAIL:** Remove scope creep OR add missing requirements, re-run check

### Gate 3: Phase 6 - User Approval
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p3_refinement.md
**What it checks:**
- User explicitly approves acceptance criteria

**Pass Criteria:** User confirmation documented
**If FAIL:** Revise acceptance criteria, get user approval

## Decision Points

### Decision 1: Feature Splitting (Phase 4)
**When:** Checklist >35 items
**Options:**
- Split into sub-features (recommended if >35 items)
- Keep as single feature (if complexity is low despite item count)

**How to decide:** Evaluate natural boundaries, ask user

### Decision 2: Question Resolution Strategy (Phase 3)
**When:** Uncertain about requirements
**Options:**
- Ask user (ONE question at a time, wait for answer)
- Research codebase (if answerable from code/docs)
- Defer to implementation (if minor detail)

**How to decide:** If impacts design → ask user. If minor detail → defer

### Decision 3: Requirement Traceability Source (Phase 2)
**For EACH requirement, cite source:**
- Epic: From epic notes (user's original request)
- User Answer: From user response to your question
- Derived: Logical consequence of Epic/User Answer

**Always cite the source** - enables verification in Phase 2.5

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Skipping Phase 0 (Discovery Context Review)
**Problem:** Starting research without re-reading epic first
**Impact:** Miss user's actual intent, research wrong things
**Solution:** ALWAYS re-read epic in Phase 0, extract exact words

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Not Citing Sources for Requirements
**Problem:** Adding requirements without noting source (Epic/User/Derived)
**Impact:** Phase 2.5 alignment check fails (can't verify against epic)
**Solution:** For EVERY requirement, cite: Epic / User Answer / Derived

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Assuming Instead of Asking User
**Problem:** Making design decisions without user input
**Impact:** Implement wrong solution, rework in S7 QC
**Solution:** When uncertain, ask user (Phase 3). Better to ask than assume

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Batching Questions
**Problem:** Asking user 5 questions at once
**Impact:** User overwhelmed, answers may be rushed/incomplete
**Solution:** ONE question at a time, wait for answer, ask next

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Shallow Research (No Evidence)
**Problem:** Saying "I researched X" without file paths/line numbers
**Impact:** Phase 1.5 audit fails (no evidence = didn't actually research)
**Solution:** Document file paths, line numbers, code snippets for ALL research

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Scope Creep in Spec
**Problem:** Adding "nice-to-have" features not requested in epic
**Impact:** Phase 2.5 alignment check fails (scope creep detected)
**Solution:** Only include what epic/user explicitly requested

### ❌ Pitfall 7: Comparing to Wrong Features (Phase 5)
**Problem:** Comparing to in-progress features instead of completed ones
**Impact:** Inherit bugs/inconsistencies from incomplete features
**Solution:** Only compare to features that completed S7 (fully QC'd)
