        • Dynamic Scope Adjustment (split if >35 items)
        • Cross-feature comparison with completed features
        • Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check ← GATE 2 (MANDATORY)
        • Acceptance Criteria + User Approval ← GATE 3

  Guide: s2_p2_cross_feature_alignment.md

## Mandatory Gates

### Gate 1: Research Completeness Audit (S2.P1.I1)
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md
**What it checks:**
- Component Research: Have you found the code mentioned in epic?
- Pattern Research: Have you studied similar features?
- Data Research: Have you located data sources?
- Discovery Context Knowledge: Did you review DISCOVERY.md during research?

**Pass Criteria:** ALL 4 categories answered with evidence (file paths, line numbers)
**If FAIL:** Return to S2.P1.I1, research gaps, re-run audit

### Gate 2: Spec-to-Epic Alignment Check (S2.P1.I3)
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md (I3)
**What it checks:**
- Scope Creep: Requirements NOT in epic notes
- Missing Requirements: Epic requests NOT in spec

**Pass Criteria:** Zero scope creep + zero missing requirements
**If FAIL:** Remove scope creep OR add missing requirements, re-run check

### Gate 3: User Checklist Approval (S2.P1.I3)
**Location:** stages/s2/s2_p1_spec_creation_refinement.md (I3)
**What it checks:**
- User explicitly approves spec.md (including acceptance criteria)
- User explicitly approves checklist.md (all questions answered)
- Zero autonomous agent resolution of checklist questions

**Pass Criteria:** User confirms approval of both spec.md and checklist.md
**If FAIL:** Revise spec/checklist based on user feedback, re-present for approval

## Decision Points

### Decision 1: Feature Splitting (S2.P1.I3)
**When:** Checklist >35 items
**Options:**
- Split into sub-features (recommended if >35 items)
- Keep as single feature (if complexity is low despite item count)

**How to decide:** Evaluate natural boundaries, ask user

### Decision 2: Question Resolution Strategy (S2.P1.I2)
**When:** Uncertain about requirements
**Options:**
- Ask user (ONE question at a time, wait for answer)
- Research codebase (if answerable from code/docs)
- Defer to implementation (if minor detail)

**How to decide:** If impacts design → ask user. If minor detail → defer

### Decision 3: Requirement Traceability Source (S2.P1.I1)
**For EACH requirement, cite source:**
- Epic: From epic notes (user's original request)
- User Answer: From user response to your question
- Derived: Logical consequence of Epic/User Answer

**Always cite the source** - enables verification in S2.P1.I3 (Gate 2)

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Skipping Discovery Context Review (I1 Step 1)
**Problem:** Starting research without re-reading epic first
**Impact:** Miss user's actual intent, research wrong things
**Solution:** ALWAYS re-read epic at S2.P1.I1 start, extract exact words

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Not Citing Sources for Requirements
**Problem:** Adding requirements without noting source (Epic/User/Derived)
**Impact:** S2.P1.I3 alignment check (Gate 2) fails (can't verify against epic)
**Solution:** For EVERY requirement, cite: Epic / User Answer / Derived

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Assuming Instead of Asking User
**Problem:** Making design decisions without user input
**Impact:** Implement wrong solution, rework in S7 QC
**Solution:** When uncertain, ask user in S2.P1.I2 (Checklist Resolution). Better to ask than assume

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Batching Questions
**Problem:** Asking user 5 questions at once
**Impact:** User overwhelmed, answers may be rushed/incomplete
**Solution:** ONE question at a time, wait for answer, ask next

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Shallow Research (No Evidence)
**Problem:** Saying "I researched X" without file paths/line numbers
**Impact:** S2.P1.I1 Gate 1 audit fails (no evidence = didn't actually research)
**Solution:** Document file paths, line numbers, code snippets for ALL research

### ❌ Pitfall 6: Scope Creep in Spec
**Problem:** Adding "nice-to-have" features not requested in epic
**Impact:** S2.P1.I3 alignment check (Gate 2) fails (scope creep detected)
**Solution:** Only include what epic/user explicitly requested

### ❌ Pitfall 7: Comparing to Wrong Features (S2.P1.I3)
**Problem:** Comparing to in-progress features instead of completed ones
**Impact:** Inherit bugs/inconsistencies from incomplete features
**Solution:** Only compare to features that completed S7 (fully QC'd)
