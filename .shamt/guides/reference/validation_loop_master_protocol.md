## Overview

**What is the Validation Loop?**
The Validation Loop is a systematic quality assurance process that validates artifacts (specs, plans, code, documentation) through iterative rounds until achieving 3 consecutive clean rounds with zero issues.

**Why use Validation Loops?**
- **Prevents cascading failures**: Catch issues early before propagating downstream
- **Eliminates redundant re-verification**: Check all concerns every round (no need to restart)
- **Guarantees quality**: 3 consecutive clean rounds ensures thorough validation
- **Consistent approach**: Same process across all stages and artifacts

**Key Innovation (from S5 v2):**
- Instead of sequential iterations checking different concerns (S5 v1 had 22 iterations)
- Use validation dimensions checked EVERY round (S5 v2 has 11 dimensions)
- Fix issues immediately, continue validation (no restart from beginning)
- Exit when 3 consecutive rounds have ZERO issues

---

## When to Use This Protocol

**Use Validation Loops for:**
- ✅ Specifications (S2: Feature specs)
- ✅ Plans (S5: Implementation plans)
- ✅ Test strategies (S4: Test plans)
- ✅ Documentation (S3: Epic documentation)
- ✅ Code quality (S7: QC rounds)
- ✅ Cross-artifact alignment (S8: Spec alignment)
- ✅ Epic-level validation (S9: Epic QC)

**Do NOT use for:**
- ❌ Simple checklists (use regular checklist)
- ❌ One-time verification (use standard review)
- ❌ User approval gates (use approval protocol)

**Typical Timing:**
- After creating draft artifact
- Before user approval gates
- After fixing issues (continue validation)

---

## Core Validation Process

### Fundamental Principles

**1. Zero Deferred Issues**
- ALL issues must be fixed immediately (not "later")
- No severity threshold (ALL levels matter: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- Cannot proceed to next round with open issues
- Fix → Re-validate → Repeat

**2. Three Consecutive Clean Rounds Required**
- Round N: 0 issues found ✅
- Round N+1: 0 issues found ✅
- Round N+2: 0 issues found ✅
- **THEN and ONLY THEN**: Exit validation loop

**3. Fresh Eyes Every Round**
- Re-read ENTIRE artifact each round (not from memory)
- Use different reading patterns/perspectives
- Approach as if seeing for first time
- Don't assume previous rounds were thorough

**4. All Dimensions Every Round**
- Check EVERY dimension EVERY round (master + scenario-specific)
- Cannot skip dimensions
- Cannot batch dimensions
- Systematic top-to-bottom review

**Counter Reset Rule:**
- Clean round counter starts at 0
- Each clean round increments counter
- ANY issue found → Counter resets to 0
- Need counter = 3 to exit

**Example:**
- Round 1: 5 issues → Fix all → Counter = 0
- Round 2: 0 issues → Counter = 1
- Round 3: 0 issues → Counter = 2
- Round 4: 1 issue → Fix → **Counter resets to 0**
- Round 5: 0 issues → Counter = 1
- Round 6: 0 issues → Counter = 2
- Round 7: 0 issues → Counter = 3 ✅ **EXIT**

## Universal Dimensions (Master - Always Checked)

These 7 dimensions apply to **ALL** validation loops, regardless of context.

### Dimension 1: Empirical Verification ⚡ CRITICAL

**Question:** Is everything claimed/referenced verified against actual reality (not assumptions)?

**Core Principle:** "Never assume - always verify from source of truth"

**Why This is Dimension 1:**
- If working with made-up facts, nothing else matters
- Must establish reality BEFORE checking completeness/consistency
- Catches issues earlier (before propagating downstream)
- Prevents cascading failures from wrong assumptions

**Checklist:**

**Code References:**
- [ ] All class names verified from source code (use grep/Read, not memory)
- [ ] All method/function names verified from source code
- [ ] All function signatures copy-pasted from actual code (not paraphrased)
- [ ] All return types verified from source code
- [ ] All parameter types verified from source code (including optional/default values)
- [ ] All exception types verified from source code

**File System:**
- [ ] All file paths verified to exist (use ls/Read, not assumption)
- [ ] All directory paths verified to exist
- [ ] All referenced data files verified to exist (actual ls output)
- [ ] All import paths verified to work (test imports)

**Configuration:**
- [ ] All config keys verified from actual config files (exact key names)
- [ ] All config value types verified (string vs int vs bool)
- [ ] All environment variables verified from actual environment

**External Dependencies:**
- [ ] All library imports verified from requirements.txt or actual imports
- [ ] All version numbers verified from actual installed versions
- [ ] All API endpoints verified from actual API (if applicable)

**Data Structures:**
- [ ] All CSV column names verified from actual files (read header row)
- [ ] All JSON keys verified from actual files (read actual JSON)
- [ ] All database table names verified from schema (if applicable)
- [ ] All field names verified from source of truth

**Evidence Documentation:**
- [ ] Every verified item has source location (file:line)
- [ ] Copy-paste of actual code provided (not summary or paraphrase)
- [ ] Verification method documented (Read tool / grep / ls command)
- [ ] Verification timestamp included
- [ ] No "assumption" or "probably" as verification method

**Common Violations:**

❌ **WRONG - Made-up function signature:**
```markdown
Task 3: Call ConfigManager.get_adp_multiplier(adp: int) -> float
Source: Assumption based on spec description
```

✅ **CORRECT - Verified from source:**
```markdown
Task 3: Call ConfigManager.get_adp_multiplier(adp: int) -> Tuple[float, int]
Source: Verified from [module]/util/ConfigManager.py:234
Verification method: Read tool
Verification timestamp: 2026-02-10 14:30

Actual signature:
    def get_adp_multiplier(self, adp: int) -> Tuple[float, int]:
        """
        Calculate ADP multiplier based on ADP ranking.

        Args:
            adp (int): ADP ranking (1-500)

        Returns:
            Tuple[float, int]: (multiplier, rating)
        """
```

❌ **WRONG - Made-up file path:**
```markdown
Load data from: data/adp_rankings.csv
Verification: Not checked (assumed from spec)
```

✅ **CORRECT - Verified path:**
```markdown
Load data from: data/rankings/adp.csv
Verification method: ls command
Verification timestamp: 2026-02-10 14:32

Command: ls -la data/rankings/adp.csv
Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 45832 Feb 10 10:15 data/rankings/adp.csv

Note: Spec mentioned "adp_rankings.csv" but actual file is in rankings/ subdirectory
```

❌ **WRONG - Assumed class name:**
```markdown
Integration: PlayerDataManager.load_players()
Source: Mentioned in epic request as "player data manager"
```

✅ **CORRECT - Verified class name:**
```markdown
Integration: PlayerManager.load_players()
Source: Verified from [module]/util/PlayerManager.py:23
Verification method: grep command

Command: grep -r "class Player.*Manager" --include="*.py"
Output: [module]/util/PlayerManager.py:23:class PlayerManager:

Note: Epic request used phrase "player data manager" but actual class is PlayerManager (no "Data")
```

**Verification Evidence Template:**
```markdown
## Dimension 1: Empirical Verification

**Item:** [Function/Class/File/Config being verified]
**Claimed in artifact:** [What the spec/plan/doc says]
**Verification method:** [Read tool / grep / ls / import test]
**Verification timestamp:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Source location:** [file:line]
**Actual reality:** [Copy-paste from actual source]
**Match status:** ✅ MATCH / ❌ MISMATCH (updated artifact)
```

**Question:** Are all required sections/elements present per template/checklist?

**Checklist:**

**Structural Completeness:**
- [ ] All mandatory sections present (per template)
- [ ] No "TBD" or "TODO" placeholders remaining
- [ ] No "..." or "etc." without specifics
- [ ] All cross-references point to existing content

**Content Completeness:**
- [ ] All requirements/tasks enumerated (not "and others")
- [ ] All edge cases identified (not "handle errors")

3. Handle errors
... (additional requirements TBD)
```

✅ **CORRECT - Complete enumeration:**
```markdown
## Requirements
1. Load player data from CSV
2. Validate player data structure
3. Calculate ADP-based scores
4. Apply position-specific adjustments
5. Handle missing data gracefully
6. Handle invalid ADP values (< 1 or > 500)
7. Handle file not found errors
8. Log all operations

(8 total requirements - all enumerated)
```

---

### Dimension 3: Internal Consistency

**Question:** Are there any contradictions or conflicts within this artifact?

**Checklist:**

**Statement Consistency:**
- [ ] No contradictory requirements ("must use X" vs "must use Y")
- [ ] No contradictory approaches (sync in one place, async in another)
- [ ] No contradictory data types (string vs int for same field)

**Terminology Consistency:**
- [ ] Same concept uses same term throughout (not "player_count" then "num_players")
- [ ] Abbreviations defined and used consistently
- [ ] Field/variable names consistent throughout

**Example Consistency:**
- [ ] Examples match specifications
- [ ] Code examples use same variable names as spec
- [ ] Sample data matches described structure

- [ ] Execution order is possible (no impossible orderings)
- [ ] Prerequisites are consistent with workflow

**Common Violations:**

❌ **WRONG - Contradictory approach:**
```markdown
## Section 1: Data Loading
Use synchronous file reading for predictable timing.

## Section 4: Performance
Use async file reading for better performance.
```

✅ **CORRECT - Consistent approach:**
```markdown
## Section 1: Data Loading
Use synchronous file reading for predictable timing and simpler error handling.

## Section 4: Performance
Optimize synchronous reading with buffering and batch processing.
```

❌ **WRONG - Inconsistent terminology:**
```markdown
## Section 2
Load player_count from config.

## Section 5
Validate that num_players is positive.
```

✅ **CORRECT - Consistent terminology:**
```markdown
## Section 2
Load player_count from config.

## Section 5
Validate that player_count is positive.
```

---

### Dimension 4: Traceability

**Question:** Can every decision/requirement be traced to an authoritative source?

**Checklist:**

**Requirement Traceability:**
- [ ] All requirements cite source (Epic Request / User Answer / Derived)
- [ ] No requirements with "assumption" as source
- [ ] Derived requirements explain derivation logic clearly
- [ ] User answers include question context and date

**Decision Traceability:**
- [ ] All design decisions cite rationale
- [ ] All "why" questions answered with source
- [ ] All trade-offs documented with reasoning
- [ ] All deviations from normal patterns explained

**Source Citation Format:**
- [ ] Epic references include line numbers (e.g., "Epic request line 45")
- [ ] User answer references include question number and date
- [ ] Derived requirements show derivation chain
- [ ] Code references include file:line

**Common Violations:**

❌ **WRONG - No source cited:**
```markdown
## Requirement 5
System must handle timeout after 30 seconds.
```

✅ **CORRECT - Source traced:**
```markdown
## Requirement 5
System must handle timeout after 30 seconds.

**Source:** User Answer to Question 12 (2026-02-08)
**Question:** "What timeout should we use for API calls?"
**Answer:** "30 seconds is standard for our APIs"
```

❌ **WRONG - Assumption as source:**
```markdown
## Requirement 8
Use JSON format for output files.

**Source:** Assumption (most Python projects use JSON)
```

✅ **CORRECT - Proper source or question:**
```markdown
## Requirement 8
Use JSON format for output files.

**Source:** Epic request line 67: "...output should be in JSON format for easy parsing..."
```

**Derived Requirement Example:**
```markdown
## Requirement 12 (Derived)
Log all API calls with timestamps.

**Source:** Derived from Requirements 5 and 9
**Derivation Logic:**
- Requirement 5: Must handle API timeouts
- Requirement 9: Must debug production issues
- Derivation: To debug timeouts in production, we need timestamps of API calls
- Therefore: Log all API calls with timestamps
```

---

### Dimension 5: Clarity & Specificity

**Question:** Is language specific, concrete, and unambiguous (no vague terms)?

**Checklist:**

**Banned Vague Terms:**
- [ ] No "should" (use "must" or "will")
- [ ] No "might" or "may" (specify conditions)
- [ ] No "probably" or "likely" (verify or make definite)
- [ ] No "usually" or "typically" (specify exact behavior)
- [ ] No "appropriate" or "reasonable" (specify criteria)
- [ ] No "etc." or "and so on" (enumerate completely)

**Specific Values Required:**
- [ ] Timeouts specified in seconds (not "reasonable timeout")
- [ ] Counts specified as numbers (not "several" or "many")
- [ ] Ranges specified with min/max (not "between 1 and 10-ish")
- [ ] Percentages exact (not "most" or "almost all")

**Concrete Actions:**
- [ ] Verbs are action-oriented (not "deal with errors")
- [ ] Steps are implementable (not "handle appropriately")
- [ ] Conditions are measurable (not "when ready")

**Unambiguous Language:**
- [ ] "Or" clarified (inclusive or exclusive?)
- [ ] "All" vs "some" explicit
- [ ] Order specified when matters (not "do A and B")

**Common Violations:**

❌ **WRONG - Vague language:**
```markdown
## Task 3
Handle errors appropriately.
Timeout should be reasonable.
Validate input as needed.
```

✅ **CORRECT - Specific language:**
```markdown
## Task 3
Handle errors with try/except blocks:
- FileNotFoundError: Log error, return empty list
- ValueError: Log error, raise with context
- ConnectionError: Retry 3 times with 5-second delays, then raise

Timeout: 30 seconds (per Requirement 5)

Validate input:
- Check adp value is integer between 1 and 500
- Raise ValueError if out of range
```

❌ **WRONG - "Should" instead of "must":**
```markdown
The system should validate player data.
```

✅ **CORRECT - Definitive language:**
```markdown
The system must validate player data before processing.
```

## Round-by-Round Execution

### Round 1: Initial Validation

**Purpose:** First systematic check of all dimensions

**Process:**
1. **Re-read entire artifact** (use Read tool, don't work from memory)
2. **Check each dimension sequentially** (1→2→3→4→5→6→7)
3. **Document findings** in validation log
4. **Categorize issues** by dimension and severity

**Documentation:**
```markdown
## Round 1 Results

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-10 15:00
**Artifact:** feature_02_spec.md (v1.0)

### Dimension 1: Empirical Verification
- ❌ ISSUE 1 (HIGH): Function signature assumed, not verified
  - Location: Section 3.2, line 45
  - Problem: Claims ConfigManager.get_adp() returns float
  - Reality: Returns Tuple[float, int] per ConfigManager.py:234
  - Fix: Update section 3.2 with correct signature

- ❌ ISSUE 2 (MEDIUM): File path not verified
  - Location: Section 2.1, line 12
  - Problem: References data/adp.csv
  - Reality: Actual path is data/rankings/adp.csv (verified with ls)
  - Fix: Update file path

### Dimension 2: Completeness
- ✅ PASS: All sections present

### Dimension 3: Internal Consistency
- ❌ ISSUE 3 (LOW): Inconsistent terminology
  - Location: Sections 2.1 and 4.3
  - Problem: Uses both "player_count" and "num_players"
  - Fix: Standardize on "player_count"

... (continue for all 7 dimensions)

**Round 1 Summary:**
- Total issues found: 8
- HIGH: 2, MEDIUM: 3, LOW: 3
- Issues must be fixed before Round 2
- Clean round counter: 0
```

**After Round 1:**
- Fix ALL issues immediately (no deferring)
- Update artifact
- Prepare for Round 2

### Round 2: Fresh Eyes Validation

**Purpose:** Re-validate with fresh perspective after fixes

**Process:**
1. **CRITICAL: Re-read ENTIRE artifact** (don't skip to changed sections)
2. **Use different reading pattern** (bottom-up, random spot-checks, etc.)
3. **Check ALL dimensions** (not just ones with issues in Round 1)
4. **Look for cross-cutting impacts** (did fix in Section 2 affect Section 5?)

**Fresh Eyes Techniques:**
- Read in reverse order (last section to first)
- Read out of sequence (random sections)
- Focus on different aspects (data flow vs error handling)
- Pretend you've never seen this before

**Documentation:**

## Round 2 Results

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-10 15:45
**Artifact:** feature_02_spec.md (v1.1 - after Round 1 fixes)
**Reading pattern:** Bottom-up (Section 5→4→3→2→1)

### Dimension 1: Empirical Verification
- ✅ PASS: All issues from Round 1 fixed and verified
- ❌ ISSUE 9 (MEDIUM): New discovery - missed in Round 1
  - Location: Section 4.5, line 89
  - Problem: References PlayerDataManager class
  - Reality: Actual class is PlayerManager (verified grep)
  - Fix: Update class name

### Dimension 2: Completeness
- ✅ PASS: Complete

... (continue for all 7 dimensions)

**Round 2 Summary:**
- Total issues found: 2 (new issues, not from Round 1)
- HIGH: 0, MEDIUM: 2, LOW: 0
- Issues must be fixed
- Clean round counter: RESETS to 0 (issues found)
```

**If issues found:**
- Fix ALL issues
- **Counter resets to 0**
- Continue to Round 3

**If 0 issues:**
- Counter = 1
- Continue to Round 3

---

### Round 3+: Achieving Clean Rounds

**Purpose:** Continue validation until 3 consecutive clean rounds

**Process (same as Round 2):**
1. Re-read entire artifact with fresh eyes
2. Use different reading pattern
3. Check ALL dimensions
4. Document findings

**Counter Logic:**

**Scenario A: Issue found in Round 3**
```markdown
Round 1: 8 issues → Fix → Counter = 0
Round 2: 2 issues → Fix → Counter = 0
Round 3: 1 issue → Fix → Counter = 0  ← RESET
Round 4: 0 issues → Counter = 1
Round 5: 0 issues → Counter = 2
Round 6: 0 issues → Counter = 3 ✅ EXIT
```

**Scenario B: Clean from Round 3 onward**
```markdown
Round 1: 5 issues → Fix → Counter = 0
Round 2: 0 issues → Counter = 1
Round 3: 0 issues → Counter = 2
Round 4: 0 issues → Counter = 3 ✅ EXIT
```

**Maximum Rounds:**
- No hard maximum (continue until 3 consecutive clean)
- Typical: 4-7 rounds total
- If exceeding 10 rounds: Re-evaluate approach (may need to redesign artifact)

## Quality Standards

### Issue Severity Classification

**HIGH Severity:**
- Made-up facts (Dimension 1 violations)
- Missing critical requirements (Dimension 2)
- Logic contradictions (Dimension 3)
- No source for requirements (Dimension 4)
- Unusable/unimplementable (Dimension 5)
- Scope creep or missing scope (Dimension 6)

**MEDIUM Severity:**
- Minor verification gaps (class name wrong but similar)
- Missing optional sections
- Terminology inconsistencies
- Vague language that could be interpreted
- Minor deviations from templates

**LOW Severity:**
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Typos that don't affect meaning
- Style guideline deviations
- Documentation formatting

**CRITICAL:** ALL severity levels must be fixed (no "we'll fix LOW later")

### Reading Patterns for Fresh Eyes

**Round 1:** Sequential (top to bottom)
**Round 2:** Reverse (bottom to top)
**Round 3:** Random spot-checks (different sections)
**Round 4:** Perspective shift (from user POV, from implementer POV)
**Round 5+:** Combination approaches

### Time Expectations

**Per Round:**
- Short artifacts (specs): 15-20 minutes
- Medium artifacts (plans): 30-40 minutes
- Long artifacts (epic docs): 45-60 minutes

**Total Validation:**
- Typical: 4-7 rounds × per-round time
- Example (medium artifact): 5 rounds × 35 min = ~3 hours
- Includes fix time between rounds

---

## Exit Criteria

**Validation Loop is COMPLETE when ALL of the following are true:**

- [ ] At least 3 rounds completed
- [ ] 3 consecutive rounds with ZERO issues found
- [ ] All 7 master dimensions checked every round
- [ ] All scenario-specific dimensions checked every round
- [ ] Clean round counter = 3
- [ ] Validation log complete with all rounds documented
- [ ] Final artifact version tagged/noted
- [ ] Summary section completed in validation log

**Cannot exit if:**
- ❌ Only 2 consecutive clean rounds
- ❌ Skipped any dimensions in any round
- ❌ Deferred any issues (even LOW severity)
- ❌ Worked from memory (didn't re-read)
- ❌ Last round found issues

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping Dimension 1 (Empirical Verification)

❌ **WRONG:**
```markdown
Round 1 Check:
- Dimension 2 (Completeness): ✅ PASS
- Dimension 3 (Consistency): ✅ PASS
[Skipped Dimension 1 - "looks fine"]
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```markdown
Round 1 Check:
- Dimension 1 (Empirical Verification):
  - [ ] Verified ConfigManager.get_adp() signature from source
  - [ ] Verified file path data/rankings/adp.csv exists
  - [ ] Verified PlayerManager class name from grep
  - Result: ❌ 2 issues found (wrong signature, wrong path)
```

**Why this matters:** Dimension 1 violations cascade (if function signature is wrong, everything depending on it is wrong)

---

### Mistake 2: Working from Memory Instead of Re-Reading

❌ **WRONG:**
```markdown
Round 3:
"I remember fixing Section 3.2 in Round 1, so I'll skip reading it again.
Just checking new sections..."
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```markdown
Round 3:
"Re-reading ENTIRE artifact from beginning, even sections I know I fixed.
Using bottom-up reading pattern for fresh perspective..."
```

**Why this matters:** Fresh eyes catch issues missed when working from memory

---

### Mistake 3: Deferring LOW Severity Issues

❌ **WRONG:**
```markdown
Round 2 Summary:
- HIGH issues: 0
- MEDIUM issues: 0
- LOW issues: 3 (formatting, will fix later)
- Counter: 1 ✅ [WRONG - issues still exist]
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```markdown
Round 2 Summary:
- HIGH issues: 0
- MEDIUM issues: 0
- LOW issues: 3 (formatting - MUST FIX NOW)
- Fix all 3 LOW issues
- Counter: RESETS to 0 (issues found)
```

**Why this matters:** Zero deferred issues principle - ALL issues matter

---

### Mistake 4: Not Resetting Counter When Issues Found

❌ **WRONG:**
```markdown
Round 3: 1 issue found → Fixed
Round 4: 0 issues
Counter: 2 [WRONG - should reset]
Round 5: 0 issues
Counter: 3 → EXIT [WRONG - didn't get 3 consecutive]
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```markdown
Round 3: 1 issue found → Fixed
Counter: RESETS to 0
Round 4: 0 issues → Counter = 1
Round 5: 0 issues → Counter = 2
Round 6: 0 issues → Counter = 3 → EXIT ✅
```

---

### Mistake 5: Batching Dimensions Instead of Checking All

❌ **WRONG:**
```markdown
Round 1: Check Dimensions 1-3
Round 2: Check Dimensions 4-7
[Never check all dimensions in single round]
```

✅ **CORRECT:**
```markdown
Round 1: Check ALL 7 dimensions + scenario-specific
Round 2: Check ALL 7 dimensions + scenario-specific
Round 3: Check ALL 7 dimensions + scenario-specific
```

**Why this matters:** Issues can span dimensions (fixing D1 might affect D6)

## How Scenario-Specific Loops Extend This Master

### Extension Pattern

**All scenario-specific validation loops:**
1. **Reference this master protocol** ("See validation_loop_master_protocol.md")
2. **Inherit all 7 master dimensions** (always checked)
3. **Add 2-8 scenario-specific dimensions** (context-dependent)
4. **Total dimensions: 9-15** per scenario

### Example: S5 Implementation Planning Loop

**Full Guide:** `stages/s5/s5_v2_validation_loop.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Validation Loop: Implementation Planning (S5)

**Extends:** Master Validation Loop Protocol
**See:** reference/validation_loop_master_protocol.md

## Master Dimensions (7) - Always Checked

1. ✅ Empirical Verification
2. ✅ Completeness
3. ✅ Internal Consistency
4. ✅ Traceability
5. ✅ Clarity & Specificity
6. ✅ Upstream Alignment
7. ✅ Standards Compliance

**See master protocol for checklists**

## Summary

**Master Validation Loop Protocol provides:**
- ✅ 7 universal dimensions (apply to ALL validation contexts)
- ✅ Core process (3 consecutive clean rounds, zero deferred issues)
- ✅ Systematic approach (all dimensions every round)
- ✅ Quality guarantee (fresh eyes, complete re-reading)
- ✅ Extensibility (scenario-specific loops add dimensions)

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply this master protocol to your validation scenario
2. Add scenario-specific dimensions (2-8 typical)
3. Follow round-by-round execution
4. Document in validation log
5. Exit when 3 consecutive clean rounds achieved

**Key Principle:**
> "Never assume - always verify. Check everything, every round, until 3 consecutive rounds are clean."
