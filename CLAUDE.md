# Shamt Master — Agent Rules

This is the **master Shamt repository**. You are working on the framework itself, not a child project.

Your primary responsibilities here are:
1. **Reviewing child PRs** — reviewing guide/script improvements submitted by child projects via pull request
2. **Master dev workflow** — making guide improvements using the standardized process
3. **AI service registry** — keeping `ai_services.md` up to date with new AI services

## Reviewing Child Project PRs

Child projects submit guide and script improvements to master via pull request (not changelog files).

The PR description will reference `.shamt/CHANGES.md` from the child project for context.

Review steps:
1. Read the PR diff — assess whether changes are truly generic (applicable to all Shamt projects)
2. If project-specific content has leaked into shared files: request changes
3. If generic: approve and merge
4. After merging, run the full guide audit on the entire `.shamt/guides/` tree — do not let changes propagate to other child projects on their next import until the audit passes
5. Commit any audit fixes before the merge is considered complete

**Proposal docs:** Child PRs may include proposal files (named `{project}-{epic}-SHAMT-UPDATE-PROPOSAL.md`) that were exported to `design_docs/incoming/`. These are always acceptable — no generic/specific evaluation needed since they are explicitly project-originated proposals for guide changes, not shared guide files themselves. Review for obvious errors but do not apply the separation rule to them. See "Child Proposal Handling" section for the promotion/rejection process.

**Full workflow guides:** `.shamt/guides/sync/export_workflow.md` (child side) and `.shamt/guides/sync/import_workflow.md` (post-import validation)

---

## Canonical Content Layer (SHAMT-39)

Three directories under `.shamt/` hold host-portable canonical content. These are **content-only** — no host-specific wiring. Regen scripts (SHAMT-40 for Claude Code, SHAMT-42 for Codex) deploy the content to host-specific locations at init/regen time.

**`.shamt/skills/`** — Skill bodies encoding Shamt protocols (validation loop, architect-builder, spec protocol, code review, guide audit, discovery, import/export, master reviewer, lite story, lite validate, lite spec, lite plan, lite review). Each skill lives in its own subdirectory as `SKILL.md`. Each SKILL.md is self-contained and includes `source_guides:` frontmatter listing every guide file it was distilled from.

**`.shamt/agents/`** — Sub-agent persona YAML definitions (`shamt-validator`, `shamt-builder`, `shamt-architect`, `shamt-guide-auditor`, `shamt-spec-aligner`, `shamt-code-reviewer`, `shamt-discovery-researcher`). Each file declares model_tier (cheap/balanced/reasoning), reasoning_effort, sandbox, tools_allowed, and prompt_template with `{placeholder}` syntax.

**`.shamt/commands/`** — Slash command bodies (`shamt-start-epic`, `shamt-validate`, `shamt-audit`, `shamt-export`, `shamt-import`, `shamt-status`, `shamt-resume`, `shamt-promote`) plus `CHEATSHEET.md`. Regen scripts copy command bodies verbatim to `.claude/commands/` (Claude Code) and `~/.codex/prompts/` (Codex).

**Child projects on prior versions** ignore these directories until they re-init or run regen — the directories are additive and backward-compatible.

**Master-applicable skills:** `shamt-validation-loop`, `shamt-guide-audit`, `shamt-code-review`, `shamt-master-reviewer`  
**Master-applicable personas:** `shamt-validator`, `shamt-builder`, `shamt-architect`, `shamt-guide-auditor`, `shamt-code-reviewer`  
**Child-only personas:** `shamt-spec-aligner`, `shamt-discovery-researcher`

Host wiring is deployed by SHAMT-40 (Claude Code) and SHAMT-42 (Codex).

---

## Claude Code Host Wiring (SHAMT-40)

`init.sh` detects Claude Code (`AI_SERVICE=claude_code`) and runs additional wiring steps:

1. Creates `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`
2. Runs `regen-claude-shims.sh` to populate them from canonical `.shamt/` content
3. Writes `.claude/settings.json` from `.shamt/host/claude/settings.starter.json` (with `${PROJECT}` resolved)
4. Writes `.shamt/config/ai_service.conf` (`claude_code`), `repo_type.conf` (`master` or `child`), and `epic_tag.conf` (project epic tag, e.g. `FF`)

**`regen-claude-shims.sh`** — deterministic transform script at `.shamt/scripts/regen/`:
- Skills: copies `SKILL.md` verbatim, managed header appended at end; skips `master-only: true` skills on child projects
- Agents: transforms YAML → Claude Code agent markdown; maps model tiers (cheap→Haiku, balanced→Sonnet, reasoning→Opus)
- Commands: copies markdown verbatim, managed header appended at end; `{placeholder}` notation is documentation-style
- Cheat sheet (SHAMT-49): generates `.shamt/CHEATSHEET.md` filtered by ai_service, pr_provider, repo_type, and features; writes `.shamt/.gitignore`
- Idempotent: user-authored files (no managed header) are preserved; safe to run on every import
- Run automatically by `import.sh` when `ai_service.conf` is `claude_code`

**`shamt-statusline.sh`** — status bar renderer at `.shamt/scripts/statusline/`:
- Reads `EPIC_TRACKER.md` → finds active epic → reads its `AGENT_STATUS.md`
- Emits: `EPIC-N | S{stage}.P{phase} | round {N} | blocker: {text or "none"}`
- Falls back to `Shamt | no active epic` when no epic is in progress

---

## Codex Host Parity (SHAMT-42)

`init.sh` detects Codex (`AI_SERVICE=codex` or `claude_codex`) and runs additional wiring steps:

1. Creates `.codex/agents/`
2. Prompts for `FRONTIER_MODEL` and `DEFAULT_MODEL`; writes `.shamt/host/codex/.model_resolution.local.toml` (gitignored)
3. Writes `.codex/config.toml` from `.shamt/host/codex/config.starter.toml`
4. Copies `.shamt/host/codex/requirements.toml.template` to project root as `requirements.toml`
5. Runs `regen-codex-shims.sh` to populate skills/agents/commands/profiles/hooks

**`--host` flag:** `init.sh --host=codex` skips the AI service menu. `--host=claude,codex` sets up both hosts (dual-host): `AGENTS.md` is the canonical rules file; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink on Unix or a duplicate on Windows.

**`regen-codex-shims.sh`** — deterministic transform script at `.shamt/scripts/regen/`:
- Skills: deploys to `~/.codex/prompts/shamt-<name>.md` (interim; see `.shamt/host/codex/README.md` for migration path)
- Agents: transforms YAML → TOML (`.codex/agents/<name>.toml`); maps model tiers (cheap→DEFAULT, balanced/reasoning→FRONTIER)
- Commands: deploys to `~/.codex/prompts/`; translates `{placeholder}` → `$PLACEHOLDER` (Codex prompt syntax)
- Profiles: concatenates `.shamt/host/codex/profiles/*.fragment.toml` into `.codex/config.toml` SHAMT-PROFILES block; substitutes `${FRONTIER_MODEL}` / `${DEFAULT_MODEL}` from `.model_resolution.local.toml`
- Hooks: writes SHAMT-HOOKS block in `.codex/config.toml` (see hook event mapping in `.shamt/hooks/README.md`)
- Cheat sheet (SHAMT-49): generates `.shamt/CHEATSHEET.md` (config-filtered); writes `.shamt/.gitignore`
- Run automatically by `import.sh` when `ai_service.conf` is `codex` or `claude_codex`

**Stage transitions as session boundaries:** Codex profiles are loaded at session start; switching profiles mid-session requires relaunching Codex with `--profile shamt-s<N>`. Stage transitions in the Shamt workflow are therefore natural session boundaries on Codex.

**`shamt-add-host.sh <host>`** (at `.shamt/scripts/initialization/`) — adds Codex or Claude Code wiring to an existing project without re-running full init.

**`requirements.toml`** — admin enforcement floor written to the project root: sandbox mode ceiling (`workspace-write`), MCP allowlist, hook source pin, secret-glob deny, approval floor.

**`permission-router.sh`** — Codex-only `hooks.permission_request` handler: auto-approves in-scope edits within the active epic folder; always escalates commits and pushes to the user; passes unknown tools through to Codex default.

**Profile fragments** — `.shamt/host/codex/profiles/*.fragment.toml` — one per Shamt stage (s1–s10) and key personas (validator, builder, architect, s6-builder). Model, reasoning effort, and sandbox mode calibrated per stage. See `.shamt/host/codex/README.md` for the full layout.

---

## Hooks and MCP Server (SHAMT-41)

**Hooks bundle** — 13 scripts in `.shamt/hooks/` (12 enforcement hooks; `permission-router.sh` is Codex-only, see SHAMT-42). For Claude Code: activated by setting `features.shamt_hooks=true` in `.claude/settings.json`; `regen-claude-shims.sh` installs registrations into `settings.json`'s `hooks` block. For Codex: `regen-codex-shims.sh` writes the `SHAMT-HOOKS` block in `.codex/config.toml` (see SHAMT-42 section above and `.shamt/hooks/README.md` for event mapping).

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `no-verify-blocker.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Block `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign` |
| `commit-format.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Enforce `feat/SHAMT-N:` or `fix/SHAMT-N:` prefix |
| `pre-export-audit-gate.sh` | UserPromptSubmit + PreToolUse | Block export if audit is stale or failed (child-only) |
| `validation-log-stamp.sh` | PostToolUse (Edit) | Append timestamp to validation logs |
| `architect-builder-enforcer.sh` | PreToolUse (Task) | S6: reject non-`shamt-builder` Task spawns |
| `user-testing-gate.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | S9: block push without user-testing confirmation (child-only) |
| `precompact-snapshot.sh` | PreCompact | Write `RESUME_SNAPSHOT.md` before compaction |
| `session-start-resume.sh` | SessionStart | Inject `RESUME_SNAPSHOT.md` as context on start |
| `subagent-confirmation-receipt.sh` | SubagentStop | Write veto flag if confirming sub-agent reports issues |
| `stage-transition-snapshot.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Write `RESUME_SNAPSHOT.md` at stage-advance phrases |

**SHAMT-44 additions:** `validation-stall-detector.sh` + `pre-push-tripwire.sh` — see Cross-Cutting Composites section.

**Master-applicable (10 of 12):** all except `pre-export-audit-gate.sh` (master doesn't export) and `user-testing-gate.sh` (S9 child-only).

**MCP server** — Python package at `.shamt/mcp/`. Install via repo-local venv:
```bash
python -m venv .shamt/mcp/.venv && source .shamt/mcp/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .shamt/mcp
```

Two tools:
- `shamt.next_number()` — atomic SHAMT-N reservation (reads/increments `design_docs/NEXT_NUMBER.txt` under OS-level lock)
- `shamt.validation_round(log_path, round, severity_counts, fixed, exit_threshold)` — appends structured round entry and returns updated `consecutive_clean` + `should_exit`. Pass `exit_threshold=1` for validation loops, `exit_threshold=3` for guide audits.

Regen registers the MCP server in `mcpServers.shamt` when the venv is found.

**Session continuity:** `precompact-snapshot.sh` + `session-start-resume.sh` replace the GUIDE_ANCHOR / Resume Instructions ritual for sessions where both hooks fire. The manual ritual remains authoritative when hooks are not installed.

---

## Codex Cloud, OTel, and SDK (SHAMT-43)

**Depends on:** SHAMT-42 (Codex CLI parity). SHAMT-43 is live.

### Cloud environment

`.shamt/host/codex/cloud-environment.template.json` — copy to project root and rename per current Codex Cloud docs. `cloud-setup.sh` runs at container provision time: installs Shamt MCP as HTTP listener (port 7400), pre-caches guides, seeds `AGENTS.md`, verifies `requirements.toml`. `cloud-maintenance.sh` runs on cached-container resume.

`init.sh --with-cloud` (Codex hosts only) copies the manifest template to the project root and prints setup notes. Verify the manifest filename against Codex Cloud docs at implementation time.

**Cloud-native S6 builder:** architect commits the validated plan, launches a Codex Cloud task with `shamt-s6-builder` profile; container executes mechanically and opens a PR on success or discards on failure (container disposability = zero local damage on failure). See `.shamt/guides/stages/s6/cloud_variant.md`.

**S7 / S9 QC fan-out:** parallel cloud tasks per validation dimension with `shamt-validator` profile. All tasks run simultaneously; one parallel fan-out where all pass = exit criterion met. See `.shamt/guides/stages/s7/cloud_variant.md` and `s9/cloud_variant.md`.

### OTel observability

`.shamt/observability/` — OTel collector preset and Grafana dashboards. Enable by uncommenting the `[telemetry]` block in `.codex/config.toml` and pointing `otlp_endpoint` at the collector. Local-Docker default; org-level deployment documented in `.shamt/observability/README.md`. No hosted master collector (privacy, cost).

Four dashboards: `shamt-overview.json`, `shamt-validation-loop.json`, `shamt-architect-builder.json`, `shamt-savings-tracker.json`. The savings-tracker measures actual token savings vs. the projected figures from SHAMT-27/30.

### SDK CI automation

`.shamt/sdk/` — two standalone Python scripts using the OpenAI Agents SDK. Both are **opt-in** — enable during `init.sh` when prompted, or copy the workflow templates manually in an existing project.

- `shamt-validate-pr.py` — PR validation gate: validates changed Shamt artifacts, posts structured comment, exits non-zero on failure. Enable: copy `shamt-validate.yml.template` → `.github/workflows/shamt-validate.yml`. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatic. Label-gate option (`needs-shamt-review`) recommended for high-PR-volume repos.
- `shamt-cron-janitor.py` — weekly stale-work scanner: proposals >30d old, stalled design docs, stale child syncs. Enable: copy `shamt-cron-janitor.yml.template` → `.github/workflows/shamt-cron-janitor.yml`. Creates `shamt-janitor` label as GitHub issues.

### Master review pipeline

`.shamt/host/codex/master-reviewer-workflow.yml.template` — **master repo only**. Copy to `.github/workflows/master-reviewer.yml`. Triggered when a PR is labeled `needs-shamt-review`. Launches a Codex Cloud task that loads `shamt-master-reviewer` skill, checks separation-rule compliance, posts a draft review comment. On task failure, posts a retry comment (not silent).

### Reviewing Child Project PRs (updated for SHAMT-43)

For code changes: `shamt-code-reviewer` agent. For guide changes: `shamt-master-reviewer` skill. For automated review on the master repo: `master-reviewer-workflow.yml` fires when `needs-shamt-review` label is applied. Full composite workflow documented in `master_review_pipeline_composite.md`.

---

## Cross-Cutting Composites (SHAMT-44)

Six documented workflows that assemble component primitives (hooks, MCP, skills, agents, slash commands) into end-to-end patterns. Each composite includes a Claude Code variant, a Codex variant (where behavior differs), and a Master Dev Variant (where applicable).

| Composite | What it assembles | Guide |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Validation loop | Skill + MCP + auto-stamp hook + stall-detector + `/loop` (optional) | `.shamt/guides/composites/validation_loop_composite.md` |
| Architect–builder | Plan mode + S5/S6 guides + builder sub-agent + `run_in_background` + worktree/container | `.shamt/guides/composites/architect_builder_composite.md` |
| Stale-work janitor | SDK cron + Claude Code CronCreate + one-shot post-event triggers | `.shamt/guides/composites/stale_work_janitor_composite.md` |
| Master review pipeline | Label trigger + `shamt-master-reviewer` + `/loop` guide audit | `.shamt/guides/composites/master_review_pipeline_composite.md` |
| Metrics / observability | Hook emission + `shamt.metrics_append()` + OTel + Grafana | `.shamt/guides/composites/metrics_observability_composite.md` |
| Rollback / recovery | Stall detection + worktree/container disposability + pre-push tripwire | `.shamt/guides/composites/rollback_recovery_composite.md` |

**New hooks (SHAMT-44):**
- `validation-stall-detector.sh/.ps1` — PostToolUse (Edit on `*VALIDATION_LOG.md`): detects `consecutive_clean=0` for ≥N rounds, writes `STALL_ALERT.md`
- `pre-push-tripwire.sh/.ps1` — PreToolUse (Bash `git push`): verifies audit clean + validation non-zero + builder log clear; bypass via `SHAMT_BYPASS_TRIPWIRE=1`

**MCP tools added (SHAMT-44):** `shamt.audit_run()`, `shamt.epic_status()`, `shamt.metrics_append()`, `shamt.export_pipeline()`, `shamt.import_pipeline()` (joined existing `shamt.next_number()` and `shamt.validation_round()`).

---

## Polish Wave (SHAMT-45)

Cache-aware model selection, reasoning escalation, AskUserQuestion gates, memory tier separation, multi-modal Discovery, /fork patterns, status line enhancement, guide pruning audit.

**Deferred items:**
- `shamt-meta-orchestrator` — speculative cross-host orchestrator (Codex doc §2.16). Revisit when 3+ child projects actively use both Claude Code and Codex and ask for cross-host orchestration. Track in this section until that condition is met.
- `TaskCreate`-based AGENT_STATUS.md replacement — conditional on Phase 8 pruning audit findings. Defer to a follow-on design doc if the audit shows AGENT_STATUS.md is over-engineered.

---

## Master Dev Workflow

For improving the guides directly:

**Guide:** `.shamt/guides/master_dev_workflow/`

Master work does **not** follow the S1-S11 epic workflow and does **not** use EPIC_TRACKER.md. The operating model:

- **Small changes:** Lightweight workflow — read, fix, audit, commit directly to a branch, open PR
- **Large changes:** Create a design doc in `design_docs/active/` (version-controlled), validate it, implement, then archive to `design_docs/archive/`
- **SHAMT-N numbers:** Sequence markers for change sets, not epic identifiers. Reserved via `design_docs/NEXT_NUMBER.txt`
- **No stage gates:** Master work proceeds at judgment, not through S1-S11 phase transitions

**Available skills and personas:** Master-applicable skills (`shamt-validation-loop`, `shamt-guide-audit`, `shamt-code-review`, `shamt-master-reviewer`) and personas (`shamt-validator`, `shamt-builder`, `shamt-architect`, `shamt-guide-auditor`, `shamt-code-reviewer`) are available for master dev work. Claude Code host wiring is live (SHAMT-40); Codex wiring is live (SHAMT-42).

**Primitives Available (master dev work):**

| Primitive | Type | Use in master dev |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| `shamt.validation_round()` | MCP tool | Track consecutive_clean across validation rounds |
| `shamt.audit_run()` | MCP tool | Record guide audit result for pre-push tripwire |
| `shamt.next_number()` | MCP tool | Atomically reserve next SHAMT-N number |
| `shamt.metrics_append()` | MCP tool | Emit metrics to sidecar.jsonl and OTel |
| `validation-log-stamp.sh` | Hook | Auto-stamps validation logs |
| `validation-stall-detector.sh` | Hook | Alerts on consecutive_clean=0 stalls |
| `pre-push-tripwire.sh` | Hook | Guards push: audit clean + validation non-zero |
| `architect-builder-enforcer.sh` | Hook | Enforces builder pattern in S6-equivalent work |
| `/shamt-validate` | Slash command | Start a self-terminating validation loop |
| `/shamt-audit` | Slash command | Start a guide audit |
| `composites/` | Guides | End-to-end assembled workflows (see SHAMT-44 section) |

See "Design Doc Lifecycle" below for the full design doc process.

## Design Doc Lifecycle

**When to create a design doc:**
- Large changes requiring planning (multi-guide, cross-cutting, architectural)
- Changes affecting multiple system behaviors
- When user requests "create a design doc"
- Judgment call — lightweight workflow works for simple fixes

**How to create a design doc:**

1. **Reserve SHAMT-N number:** Read `design_docs/NEXT_NUMBER.txt` (e.g., contains "27"), use that number, increment the file to "28", commit
2. **Create from template:** Use `.shamt/guides/templates/design_doc_template.md` to create `design_docs/active/SHAMT{N}_DESIGN.md`
3. **Write design:** Capture problem statement, goals, proposals, implementation plan, validation strategy
4. **Validate:** Run 7-dimension validation loop (see Design Doc Validation section below)
5. **Implement:** Execute plan on `feat/SHAMT-N` branch. Post-implementation: run a D-COVERAGE pass — verify guide changes have corresponding SKILL.md updates and vice versa. D-DRIFT/D-COVERAGE audit catches gaps, but fixing during implementation is cheaper.
6. **Validate implementation:** Run implementation validation loop (see Implementation Validation section below)
7. **Archive:** Move `SHAMT{N}_DESIGN.md` and validation log to `design_docs/archive/` when complete

**Lifecycle states and their primitives (SHAMT-45):**

- **Draft** (`active/`) — Being written, not yet validated
  - `shamt.next_number()` — atomic SHAMT-N reservation
  - `precompact-snapshot.sh` + `session-start-resume.sh` — context preservation across sessions

- **Validated** (`active/`) — Passed 7-dimension validation, ready for implementation
  - `validation_loop_composite.md` — assembled 7D loop with `/loop` self-pacing and stall detection
  - `shamt.validation_round()` — tracks `consecutive_clean` across rounds
  - `validation-log-stamp.sh` — auto-stamps each log edit
  - `shamt-validator` sub-agents — Haiku confirmers for exit criterion

- **In Progress** (`active/`) — Implementation underway on branch
  - `architect_builder_composite.md` — optional for large implementations (>10 file ops)
  - `validation-stall-detector.sh` — fires STALL_ALERT.md when validation is stuck
  - `pre-push-tripwire.sh` — blocks push if audit is stale or validation shows `consecutive_clean=0`

- **Implemented** (`archive/`) — Implementation complete, branch merged
  - `shamt.audit_run()` — records guide audit result for pre-push tripwire
  - `shamt.metrics_append()` — emit retrospective metrics to sidecar.jsonl

**Validation log:** Create `SHAMT{N}_VALIDATION_LOG.md` alongside design doc when starting validation. Moves to archive with design doc.

## Design Doc Validation

When asked to validate a design doc, run a validation loop following `.shamt/guides/design_doc_validation/validation_workflow.md`.

**The 7 dimensions:**

1. **Completeness** — Are all necessary aspects covered? Is the problem fully stated? Are all affected files identified? Are edge cases and failure modes addressed?
2. **Correctness** — Are factual claims accurate? Do proposed changes actually work the way described? Are references to existing guides/files accurate?
3. **Consistency** — Is the design internally consistent? Does it conflict with existing guide conventions or other SHAMT decisions?
4. **Helpfulness** — Do the proposals actually solve the stated problem? Is the benefit worth the complexity added?
5. **Improvements** — Are there simpler or better ways to achieve the same goal?
6. **Missing proposals** — Is anything important left out of scope that should be addressed here?
7. **Open questions** — Are there unresolved decisions that need to be surfaced before implementation?

**Exit criterion:** Primary clean round (all 7 dimensions pass with ≤1 LOW-severity issue) + 2 independent sub-agents both confirming zero issues (`consecutive_clean = 1`, then spawn 2 parallel sub-agents). See `reference/severity_classification_universal.md` for severity definitions.

**Detailed workflow:** See `.shamt/guides/design_doc_validation/` for complete validation process, validation log template, and guidance.

---

## Implementation Validation

After implementing a design doc (Phases 1-4 complete), run an implementation validation loop to verify the design was fully and correctly implemented.

**The 5 dimensions:**

1. **Completeness** — Was every proposal implemented? Walk through all proposals and verify corresponding changes exist.
2. **Correctness** — Does the implementation match what was proposed? Check folder structures, file contents, script changes.
3. **Files Affected Accuracy** — Were all files in the "Files Affected" table actually created/modified/moved as specified?
4. **No Regressions** — Did the implementation break anything that was working before?
5. **Documentation Sync** — Do CLAUDE.md, master_dev_workflow.md, and other guides accurately reflect the new system?

**Exit criterion:** Same as design doc validation — primary clean round (≤1 LOW-severity issue) + 2 independent sub-agent confirmations.

**After implementation validation passes:** Run a full guide audit on the entire `.shamt/guides/` tree (not just files affected by the design doc) to ensure the repo is in a healthy state. The audit must achieve 3 consecutive clean rounds.

---

## Child Proposal Handling

Child projects can export design proposals to master via the export script. Proposals land in `design_docs/incoming/`.

**Review process:**
1. Read the proposal file in `incoming/`
2. Assess whether it warrants a full design doc or can be handled as a direct guide update
3. **If promoting to design doc:** Reserve SHAMT-N, create design doc in `active/` incorporating the proposal, delete or archive the original proposal
4. **If rejecting:** Move to `archive/rejected/` with a rejection note at the top of the file explaining why
5. **If implementing directly:** Make the guide changes, reference the proposal in commit message, archive the proposal

**Naming convention:** Child proposals use `{project}-{epic}-SHAMT-UPDATE-PROPOSAL.md` format for traceability.

---

## Code Review Workflow

The code review framework is used in three contexts:

1. **Formal code reviews** (external PRs, teammate branches)
2. **S7.P3** (Feature PR Review - part of S1-S11 epic workflow)
3. **S9.P4** (Epic PR Review - part of S1-S11 epic workflow)

**Trigger phrases:** "review branch", "do a code review of", "review the changes on", "re-review"

**Guide:** `.shamt/guides/code_review/` (README → code_review_workflow.md)

**Formal reviews:** Produces `.shamt/code_reviews/<sanitized-branch>/` with a validated `overview.md` (ELI5 + What/Why/How) and a versioned `review_vN.md` with copy-paste-ready PR comments.

**S7/S9 reviews:** Fresh sub-agent code review pattern (integrated into S7.P3 and S9.P4 guides). Skips overview.md creation, adds Dimension 13 (Implementation Fidelity), validates implementation matches plans and specs. See `code_review/s7_s9_code_review_variant.md`.

**Key rules:**
- Never checks out the branch — read-only git commands only
- On re-review: creates `review_v2.md`, `review_v3.md`, etc. — never overwrites previous versions
- If branch cannot be fetched: halt and report to user immediately

---

## Updating the AI Service Registry

When a new AI service is discovered (reported by a child project or user):

1. Research the service's rules file convention
2. Add an entry to `.shamt/scripts/initialization/ai_services.md`
3. Update the init scripts if the service needs special handling
4. Commit the change with a descriptive message

---

## Shamt Lite

**What it is:** A standalone lightweight version of Shamt that provides a six-phase story workflow (Intake → Spec → Plan → Build → Review → Polish) plus 5 core quality patterns, without the full S1-S11 epic framework.

**Target users:** Developers who want systematic quality patterns and a ticket-to-shipped workflow but don't need epic tracking or the full Shamt workflow.

**Master repo storage:** `.shamt/scripts/initialization/` — `SHAMT_LITE.template.md`, `story_workflow_lite.template.md`, `CHANGES.template.md`, `init_lite.sh/.ps1`, `lite/commands/` (5 commands), `lite/agents/` (2 personas), `lite/profiles-codex/` (8 fragments), `lite/rules-cursor/` (5 `.mdc` files; SHAMT-52), `reference/` (3 files), `templates/` (7 templates). Cursor host config at `.shamt/host/cursor/`.

**Lite skills** live in `.shamt/skills/shamt-lite-*/SKILL.md` (prefixed `shamt-lite-*`; all five carry `master-only: false`).

**Per-host regen scripts:** `regen-lite-claude.sh/.ps1` (deploys to `.claude/{skills,commands,agents}/`), `regen-lite-codex.sh/.ps1` (deploys to `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, `SHAMT-LITE-PROFILES` block), `regen-lite-cursor.sh/.ps1` (SHAMT-52; deploys to `.cursor/{skills,commands,rules,agents}/`). All at `.shamt/scripts/regen/`; run automatically by `init_lite.sh`.

**Cursor host directory:** `.shamt/host/cursor/` — `README.md` + `.model_resolution.local.toml.example`. The per-developer gitignored resolution file (`CHEAP_MODEL = "inherit"`) is written by `init_lite.sh --host=cursor` into `<child>/shamt-lite/host/cursor/`.

**Key principle:** `SHAMT_LITE.md` is standalone and executable. An agent can run all 5 patterns using only that file. `story_workflow_lite.md` adds the full story workflow narrative for ticket-based work.

**Host wiring (Tier 1+2, SHAMT-51 + SHAMT-52):**

| Flag | Result |
|---|---|
| (no flag) | Standalone — `shamt-lite/` only |
| `--host=claude` | `.claude/{skills,commands,agents}/` |
| `--host=codex` | `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, 8 `SHAMT-LITE-PROFILES` |
| `--host=cursor` | `.cursor/{skills,commands,rules,agents}/`; 5 attachment-aware `.mdc` rules; prompts for `CHEAP_MODEL` |
| `--host=claude,codex` | Both; `AGENTS.md` canonical, `CLAUDE.md` symlinked (Unix) or duplicated |
| `--host=cursor,codex` | Both Cursor + Codex; independent, no symlinking |
| `--with-mcp` | Reserved (Tier 3, deferred) |

**Master repo storage also includes:** `lite/rules-cursor/` (5 `.mdc` rule files for Cursor). Full details in `SHAMT_LITE.template.md`.

**Tier 3 (hooks + MCP) is deferred for Lite.** Users who need MCP / hooks / S1–S11 should migrate to full Shamt.

**Lite vs. full Shamt validation:** Lite validation loops use **1 sub-agent** confirmation (not 2). This applies to all Lite artifacts (specs, plans, reviews). Full Shamt retains 2 sub-agents. Lite `CHANGES.md` entries are proposals; master does not depend on any sync cadence.

**When to update Shamt Lite:**
- When validation loop mechanics change in the canonical guides
- When severity classification rules are refined
- When spec protocol, code review, or implementation planning patterns improve
- Never copy epic-specific content into lite files

**Maintenance rule:** Shamt Lite files are NOT synced via import/export. They are maintained directly in the master repo and versioned independently.

## Architecture & Coding Standards Maintenance

Child projects maintain ARCHITECTURE.md and CODING_STANDARDS.md through the S1-S11 workflow:

- **S1.P3 Discovery:** Review existing docs, check for undocumented additions (Step 3b)
- **S7.P3 Final Review:** Complete Documentation Impact Assessment (Step 1b)
- **S10 Final Changes & Merge:** Final Architecture/Standards Review (Step 1e)

**Audit:** D23 (Architecture/Standards Currency) validates document freshness and accuracy during audits. Threshold: 60 days.

**Master role:** When reviewing child PRs that update these templates, verify metadata sections (Last Updated, Update History, Update Triggers, How to Update) are present.

---

## Git Conventions

- **Branch format:** `feat/SHAMT-{N}` or `fix/SHAMT-{N}`
- **Commit format:** `feat/SHAMT-{N}: {message}` or `fix/SHAMT-{N}: {message}`
- **Default branch:** `main`
- **No AI attribution** in commit messages

---

## Critical Rules

- Zero autonomous conflict resolution — always escalate to user when uncertain
- Run guide audit after every set of guide changes
- Never approve child PRs that contain project-specific content in shared guide files
- When any change affects system behavior (new sync scripts, new guides, new audit scope, new workflow steps): review and update the three master-only files that are not propagated via import — `CLAUDE.md`, root `README.md`, and `scripts/initialization/RULES_FILE.template.md`
- Guide audits require 3 CONSECUTIVE clean rounds (where each round has ≤1 LOW-severity issue) to exit (track `consecutive_clean >= 3`). Workflow validation loops (S7.P2, S9.P2, etc.) exit on **primary clean round + independent sub-agent confirmation** (`consecutive_clean = 1`, then spawn 2 parallel sub-agents both confirming zero issues). A round is clean if it has ZERO issues OR exactly ONE LOW-severity issue (fixed). Multiple LOW-severity issues OR any MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL severity issue resets `consecutive_clean` to 0. Track `consecutive_clean` explicitly and state it at the end of every round. See `reference/severity_classification_universal.md` for severity definitions.

## Model Selection for Token Optimization (SHAMT-27)

**Purpose:** MANDATORY token optimization through strategic model delegation (30-50% savings)

**CRITICAL:** Model selection is not optional. When workflow guides specify delegation patterns (e.g., "Spawn Haiku → File operations"), you MUST use the Task tool with the specified model parameter.

**Quick Reference:**
- **Haiku** (cheap, fast): File operations, git operations, grep/glob searches, tests, sub-agent confirmations
- **Sonnet** (balanced): Code reading, structural analysis, medium-complexity tasks
- **Opus** (deep reasoning): Validation, root cause analysis, design decisions, complex multi-dimensional checks

**Key Workflows:**
- **Guide Audit:** 40-50% savings (Haiku for pre-checks/counting, Sonnet for structural, Opus for content)
- **Validation Loops:** 30-45% savings (Haiku for mechanical, Sonnet for code reading, Opus for validation)
- **Code Review:** 30-40% savings (Haiku for git ops, Sonnet for ELI5, Opus for issue classification)
- **Sub-Agent Confirmations:** 70-80% savings (always use Haiku - focused verification, not deep reasoning)

**Complete Guide:** See `.shamt/guides/reference/model_selection.md` for decision framework, task catalog, Task tool examples, and common mistakes.

**When to Use:** Spawn sub-agents with the `model` parameter in the Task tool when delegation will save tokens without degrading quality. Always delegate sub-agent confirmations to Haiku.

**When NOT to Use:** Parallel work coordination (use Sonnet for consistency), tasks requiring existing context (avoid context switching overhead).

## Architect-Builder Implementation Pattern (SHAMT-30)

**Purpose:** Two-stage implementation pattern that separates planning (architect) from execution (builder) for 60-70% token savings on implementation execution.

**Usage:**

**MANDATORY** for S1-S11 epic workflow:
- S6 implementation execution MUST use architect-builder pattern (no exceptions)
- No traditional implementation option (architect executing own plan)
- Rationale: S1-S11 workflow is exclusively for non-trivial changes

**OPTIONAL** for master dev workflow and ad-hoc work:
- Use when: >10 file operations, >100K tokens with traditional approach, complex dependencies, unfamiliar codebase
- Skip when: 1-5 file changes, exploratory work, rapid iteration, prototypes
- See decision tree in `reference/architect_builder_pattern.md`

**Key Files:**
- `reference/architect_builder_pattern.md` — decision tree, mechanics, error recovery
- `reference/implementation_plan_format.md` — plan format, CREATE/EDIT/DELETE/MOVE, 9 validation dimensions
- `templates/implementation_plan_template.md` — plan template
- `templates/implementation_plan_validation_log_template.md` — validation log template

**Workflow:**
1. **S5 Phase 1:** Architect creates mechanical implementation plan (step-by-step file operations with exact details)
2. **S5 Phase 2:** Architect validates plan (9-dimension loop — see `reference/implementation_plan_format.md`)
3. **Gate 5:** User approves validated plan
4. **S6:** Architect creates handoff package, spawns Haiku builder (`model="haiku"`); builder executes sequentially; architect monitors and fixes on error

**Token Savings:** 60-70% on implementation execution (Haiku builder vs. Sonnet/Opus architect)

**Integration Points:**
- S2: Added Dimension 10 (Design Completeness) to spec validation - ensures specs contain complete architectural/design detail (prerequisite for mechanical planning)
- S5: Creates and validates mechanical implementation plans (9-dimension loop)
- S6: Creates handoff package, spawns Haiku builder for execution
- Master dev: Optional integration at Step 3.5 with decision criteria
